tt0111161,It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving.
tt0111161,Gripping...compelling.
tt0111161,"Central to the film's success is a riveting, unfussy performance from Robbins. Freeman has the showier role, allowing him a grace and dignity that come naturally."
tt0111161,"There are times when The Shawshank Redemption comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. [23 Sept 1994, p.C3]"
tt0111161,[Darabont] makes you feel the maddening pace of prison time without letting his picture succumb to it.
tt0111161,"At times poignant, joyful, and terrifying, Shawshank Redemption is an altogether brilliant movie and the debut of an equally brilliant director."
tt0111161,"Whitmore's Brooks is a brilliantly-realized character, and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank represents one of the film's most moving -- and effective -- sequences."
tt0111161,"Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil."
tt0111161,"Shouldering a laconic-good-guy, neo- Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience."
tt0111161,"Speaking of jail, ""Shawshank""-the-movie seems to last about half a life sentence. The story, chiefly about the 20-year friendship between Freeman and Robbins, becomes incarcerated in its own labyrinthine sentimentality."
tt0068646,"Just about as great as a movie's ever gonna be... As for the storytellng, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that simultaneously kicks ass."
tt0068646,"The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion... It was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual."
tt0068646,The wedding sequence... is a virtuoso stretch of filmmaking: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world.
tt0068646,"In scene after scene -- the long wedding sequence, John Marley's bloody discovery in his bed, Pacino nervously smoothing down his hair before a restaurant massacre, the godfather's collapse in a garden -- Coppola crafted an enduring, undisputed masterpiece. [21 Mar 1997, Daily Datebook, p.C3]"
tt0068646,One of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment. [16 Mar 1972]
tt0068646,"A great American picture, full of incredible images and lasting moments."
tt0068646,The Godfather traces the arc of this doomed idealism with a beauty that is still fresh.
tt0068646,"Sharp, entertaining, and convincing--discursive, but with a sense of structure and control that Coppola hasn't achieved since."
tt0068646,"Overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. And its deaths, like that of Hotspur in ""Henry IV, Part I,"" continue to shock no matter how often we've watched them coming. [16 Mar 1997, Calendar, p.7]"
tt0068646,"Overlong at about 175 minutes (played without intermission), and occasionally confusing. While never so placid as to be boring, it is never so gripping as be superior screen drama."
tt0468569,"Enthralling...An ambitious, full-bodied crime epic of gratifying scope and moral complexity, this is seriously brainy pop entertainment that satisfies every expectation raised by its hit predecessor and then some."
tt0468569,"Bale again brilliantly personifies all the deep traumas and misgivings of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne. A bit of Hamlet is in this Batman."
tt0468569,"Beyond dark. It's as black -- and teeming and toxic -- as the mind of the Joker. ""Batman Begins,"" the 2005 film that launched Nolan's series, was a mere five-finger exercise. This is the full symphony."
tt0468569,"Christopher Nolan has provided movie-goers with the best superhero movie to-date, outclassing previous titles both mediocre and excellent, and giving this franchise its ""The Empire Strikes Back."""
tt0468569,"At two hours and 32 minutes, this is almost too much movie, but it has a malicious, careening zest all its own. It's a ride for the gut AND the brain."
tt0468569,"No fair giving away the mysteries of The Dark Knight. It's enough to marvel at the way Nolan -- a world-class filmmaker, be it ""Memento,"" ""Insomnia"" or ""The Prestige"" -- brings pop escapism whisper-close to enduring art."
tt0468569,"The Dark Knight is dark, all right: It's a luxurious nightmare disguised in a superhero costume, and it's proof that popcorn entertainments don't have to talk down to their audiences in order to satisfy them. The bar for comic-book film adaptations has been permanently raised."
tt0468569,"You may emerge more exhausted than elated. Nolan wants to prove that a superhero movie needn't be disposable, effects-ridden junk food, and you have to admire his ambition. But this is Batman, not ""Hamlet."" Call me shallow, but I wish it were a little more fun."
tt0468569,"The novelty wears off and the lack of imagination, visual and otherwise, turns into a drag. The Dark Knight is noisy, jumbled, and sadistic."
tt0468569,"The Dark Knight is hardly routine--it has a kicky sadism in scene after scene, which keeps you on edge and sends you out onto the street with post-movie stress disorder."
tt0071562,"And with supporting roles from the likes of Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Lee Strasberg, to say nothing of Roger Corman and Harry Dean Stanton in bit parts, this is nothing short of magisterial."
tt0071562,"As the beginning of Part II echoes the opening of ""The Godfather,"" so too does the end. Because of the manner in which circumstances are handled and considering the people involved, the impact here is more forceful. The tragic flaw has accomplished its poisonous, inevitable designs. Coppola punctuates both movies with a gut-twisting exclamation point."
tt0071562,"Cinematographer Willis superbly captures the turn-of-the-century period, applying a seriographic tint to flashback scenes for a softer, richer look than the sharp image of the ongoing contemporary story."
tt0071562,"This is quite simply one of the saddest movies ever made, a tale of loss, grief and absolute loneliness, an unflinching stare into the darkest moral abyss."
tt0071562,"The plotting is elliptical and the sweep intoxicates, but the contrast between De Niro’s meditative Vito and Pacino’s soul-starved eyes brings piercing focus to Coppola’s resonating study of corrupting power."
tt0071562,"Al Pacino again is outstanding as Michael Corleone, successor to crime family leadership."
tt0071562,It is neither a very happy or driving picture. But it is intellectually daring and marks an important breakthrough in the growing up of the Hollywood film.
tt0071562,"Coppola is unable to draw all this together and make it work on the level of simple, absorbing narrative. The stunning text of ""The Godfather"" is replaced in Part II with prologues, epilogues, footnotes, and good intentions."
tt0071562,"Three hours and 20 minutes of Al Pacino suffering openly, Robert Duvall suffering silently, Diane Keaton suffering noisily, and (every so often) Robert De Niro suffering good-naturedly is almost too much, but Francis Ford Coppola pulls it off in grand style."
tt0071562,"The only remarkable thing about Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, Part II is the insistent manner in which it recalls how much better his original film was...Even if Part II were a lot more cohesive, revealing, and exciting than it is, it probably would have run the risk of appearing to be the self-parody it now seems."
tt0050083,The movie plays like a textbook for directors interested in how lens choices affect mood.
tt0050083,"A penetrating, sensitive, and sometimes shocking dissection of the hearts and minds of men who obviously are something less than gods. It makes for taut, absorbing, and compelling drama that reaches far beyond the close confines of its jury room setting."
tt0050083,"What's most interesting about the intense deliberations that ensue, specifically when a piece of seemingly indisputable evidence is brought back into question, is how a fresh angle and perspective, usually born from Juror 8's critical thinking, can permanently alter the tone of the discussion."
tt0050083,"Few film directors can resist the urge to ""open out"" a story, to broaden the view and bring in as wide a variety of sets and locations as the narrative - and budget - will allow. The genius of Sidney Lumet's astonishingly powerful 12 Angry Men is that he does exactly the opposite: he takes an already small, claustrophobic space - a jury room - and makes it even more confined."
tt0050083,"Too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet’s window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily."
tt0050083,"Sidney Lumet's dazzling debut, based on Reginald Rose's teleplay, delivers a masterclass in the pure dynamism of acting, as Henry Fonda's reasonable doubt gradually sways the 11 other jurors from their various prejudices."
tt0050083,"Perhaps the motivations of each juror are introduced too quickly and are repeated too often before each changes his vote. However, the film leaves a tremendous impact."
tt0050083,"What really transforms the piece from a rather talky demonstration that a man is innocent until proven guilty, is the consistently taut, sweltering atmosphere, created largely by Boris Kaufman's excellent camerawork. The result, however devoid of action, is a strangely realistic thriller."
tt0050083,"The stakes of those deliberations are so high, the personalities of the jurors so forceful, and the arguments so pregnant with importance that there is no instance in which boredom threatens."
tt0050083,"Mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods."
tt0108052,"What is surprising is how well Spielberg captures the horror, moving his camera with the fury of a combat photographer on the run. [17 Dec 1993]"
tt0108052,"The other key part is Schindler's Jewish accountant, played with self-effacing brilliance by Ben Kingsley, who gives the movie just the touch of warmth and sanity it needs."
tt0108052,"Director Steven Spielberg has achieved something close to the impossible--a morally serious, aesthetically stunning historical epic that is nonetheless readily accessible to a mass audience."
tt0108052,"What is most amazing about this film is how completely Spielberg serves his story. The movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen. Individual scenes are masterpieces of art direction, cinematography, special effects, crowd control."
tt0108052,Spielberg restages the Holocaust with an existential vividness unprecedented in any nondocumentary film: He makes us feel as if we're living right inside the 20th century's darkest-and most defining-episode.
tt0108052,"Epic cinema, tragic drama, it is also an act of remembrance and conscience that ultimately transcends the ordinary critical categories."
tt0108052,Evinces an artistic rigor and unsentimental intelligence unlike anything the world's most successful filmmaker has demonstrated before.
tt0108052,"The movie's ending at the train station and the modern-day epilogue feel protracted and indulgent...Apart from the ending though, this is Spielberg's most articulate movie ever."
tt0108052,A powerful and affecting piece of work.
tt0108052,"Spielberg does an uncommonly good job both of holding our interest over 185 minutes and of showing more of the nuts and bolts of the Holocaust than we usually get from fiction films. Despite some characteristic simplifications, he's generally scrupulous about both his source and the historical record."
tt0167260,"The conclusion of Peter Jackson's masterwork is passionate and literate, detailed and expansive, and it's conceived with a risk-taking flair for old-fashioned movie magic at its most precious."
tt0167260,An epic success and a history-making production that finishes with a masterfully entertaining final installment.
tt0167260,"The second installment was better than the first, and this one is best of all. It has spectacular action scenes and imaginary creatures, and it’s by far the most moving chapter. The performances have deepened."
tt0167260,The second half of the film elevates all the story elements to Beethovenian crescendo. Here is an epic with literature's depth and opera's splendor -- and one that could be achieved only in movies. What could be more terrific?
tt0167260,"Represents that filmmaking rarity -- a third part of a trilogy that is decisively the best of the lot. With epic conflict, staggering battles, striking landscapes and effects, and resolved character arcs all leading to a dramatic conclusion to more than nine hours of masterful storytelling."
tt0167260,"Those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll."
tt0167260,"Labeling this as a ""movie"" is almost an injustice. This is an experience of epic scope and grandeur, amazing emotional power, and relentless momentum."
tt0167260,"Jackson is rare among the makers of epic movies in that he knows how to do the small stuff, too. The Return of the King has “heart”--how else could it pump out all that blood?"
tt0167260,"The most emotionally satisfying because, in addition to having both more intimate drama and more spectacular battles, it resolves all of the issues raised before."
tt0167260,"A majestic conclusion to a nine-plus-hours epic that stirs the heart, mind and soul as few films ever have."
tt0110912,Pulp Fiction isn't just funny. It's outrageously funny. [14 Oct 1994]
tt0110912,"For a brutal black comedy about L.A. hitmen, Pulp Fiction bursts out of its binding with loopy delights. [14 Oct 1994]"
tt0110912,"It is an exhilaration from beginning to end. It's the movie equivalent of that rare sort of novel where you find yourself checking to see how many pages are left and hoping there are more, not fewer."
tt0110912,"Like ""Citizen Kane,"" Pulp Fiction is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next."
tt0110912,"With this film, every layer that you peel away leads to something deeper and richer. Tarantino makes pictures for movie-lovers, and Pulp Fiction is a near-masterpiece."
tt0110912,"The new King Kong of crime movies...Ferocious fun without a trace of caution, complacency or political correctness to inhibit its 154 deliciously lurid minutes."
tt0110912,"Pulp Fiction is at least three movies rolled into one, and they're all scintillating."
tt0110912,"A spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture, Pulp Fiction is the ""American Graffiti"" of violent crime pictures."
tt0110912,"The first masterwork of the post-modern pop culture generation...gets better with every viewing, and like good rock n' roll, needs to be played loud!"
tt0110912,"But the way that this picture has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming. [14 Nov 1994]"
tt0120737,I see it as nearly perfect: It's one of the best fantasy pictures ever made.
tt0120737,"An extraordinary work, grandly conceived, brilliantly executed and wildly entertaining. It's a hobbit's dream, a wizard's delight. And, of course, it's only the beginning."
tt0120737,"Against all odds in an era of machine-made spectaculars, Mr. Jackson and his collaborators have created a film epic that lives and breathes."
tt0120737,"The Movie Works. It has real passion, real emotion, real terror, and a tactile sense of evil that is missing in that other current movie dealing with wizards, wonders and wickedness."
tt0120737,"So consistently involving because the excellent cast delivers their lines with the kind of utter conviction not seen in this kind of movie since the first ""Star Wars."""
tt0120737,"The film's single downside is a certain nagging sense of deja vu: the fact that so many of the elements of the story -- the dark force, the all-empowering object, etc. -- have been usurped over the years (by ""Star Wars"" and others) that you feel as if you've been down this road many, many times before."
tt0120737,"The film succeeds as massive, astonishing entertainment; verily, enthralling us is its chief goal."
tt0120737,"Jackson's dazzling vision turns the story into a real movie-movie -- one that, unlike too many fantasy films today, is genuinely transporting."
tt0120737,"Above all, Jackson evokes an almost palpable sense of the will to power trapped within the ring. Without this evocation of the ring's insidious ability to sniff out the potential for corruption and capitalize on it, the entire enterprise would be precious drivel."
tt0120737,"But moving across this tableau is Frodo and his gang, and here the trouble lies...Not a one seems believable as conveyed by Wood, who forever looks to be on the brink of a good sob. Likewise, his hobbit sidekick Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) is a real wuss."
tt0060196,"Though ordained from the beginning, the three-way showdown that climaxes the film is tense and thoroughly astonishing."
tt0060196,"An improbable masterpiece -- a bizarre mixture of grandly operatic visuals, grim brutality and sordid violence that keeps wrenching you from one extreme to the other."
tt0060196,"There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who love Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and those who resist the machismo and gallows humor of what is arguably the definitive spaghetti western."
tt0060196,Gorgeously stoic art film.
tt0060196,"A massive, many-faceted film that continues to hold up, viewing after viewing."
tt0060196,"All told, and in giant widescreen, it's only blood-red adolescent fun, but it blooms like Douglas Sirk with a Gatling gun compared to the teenage demographic's current fare. Matrix, schmatrix: This is the season's supreme party movie."
tt0060196,"A curious amalgam of the visually striking, the dramatically feeble and the offensively sadistic."
tt0109830,"Passionate and magical, Forrest Gump is a tonic for the weary of spirit."
tt0109830,"Manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop."
tt0109830,"The results are skillful, highly affecting, and ultimately more than a little pernicious."
tt0109830,"A remarkable balance of sentimentality and harshness, darkness and light."
tt0109830,"Doesn't sound like a very prepossessing title, but prepare to be taken aback by ""what's in a name."" [6 July 1994, Life, p.1D]"
tt0109830,The film's technical brilliance and sentimental kick seduced many viewers unsuspecting of its polemical intent.
tt0109830,"It's most successful when it is being off-center, a state of grace it doesn't quite have the nerve to maintain. [6 July 1994, Calendar, p. F-1]"
tt0109830,"Has the elements of an emotionally gripping story. Yet is feels less like a romance than like a coffee-table book celebrating the magic of special effect. [6 July 1994, p. C9]"
tt0109830,"Clearly a great event, Forrest Gump is not, however, a great film. It has the form of an epic without real depth or resonance; the trappings of satire without a coherent attitude; and the semblance of historical revisionism without a critical sensibility."
tt0109830,"It is also glib, shallow, and monotonous, a movie that spends so much time sanctifying its hero that, despite his ""innocence,"" he ends up seeming about as vulnerable as Superman."
tt0137523,Delivers a sucker punch to the audience and then pulls the rug out from under it. It is sensational. It is also grimly funny.
tt0137523,Fight Club -- cue the blurb machine -- is a knockout.
tt0137523,"The sardonic, testosterone-fueled science fiction of Fight Club touches a raw nerve."
tt0137523,"As a piece of storytelling, Fight Club is a bit of a dud: It's a good 15 minutes too long, and the tension doesn't build the way you wish it would."
tt0137523,A provocative experience that lights you up even as it brutalizes you. And I don't even like Brad Pitt very much.
tt0137523,Keeps filmgoers wondering what will happen next even as they are repulsed by what's happening in front of them.
tt0137523,It's fun to talk about...but the price you pay is enduring its excesses and pummeled-home thematic points.
tt0137523,"This exercise in mainstream masochism, macho posturing, and designer-grunge fascism is borderline ridiculous. But it also happens to be David Fincher's richest movie."
tt0137523,"But the second act is pandering and the third is trickery, and whatever Fincher thinks the message is, that's not what most audience members will get."
tt0137523,"But imagination and energy are often not enough. On balance, this is the dumbest of the entries in Hollywood's anti-consumerist new wave."
tt0167261,"The miracle is that 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is better: tighter, smarter, funnier."
tt0167261,"Towers, while not quite so varied as Fellowship in its moods and settings, has a grave gusto that energizes every moment...a thrilling work of film craft."
tt0167261,"The Two Towers moves faster, covers more ground, has more action and -- with the introduction of the marvelous character Gollum -- packs some much-appreciated laughs."
tt0167261,"Never has a film so strongly been a product of a director's respect for its source. Mr. Jackson uses all his talents in the service of that reverence, creating a rare perfect mating of filmmaker and material."
tt0167261,"The year's greatest adventure, and Jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul."
tt0167261,"Has a sharper narrative focus and a livelier sense of forward movement than did the more episodic ""Fellowship."""
tt0167261,God forbid this should ever play on an IMAX screen -- the concussive soundtrack and relentless visuals would likely strike viewers deaf and blind (but what a way to go!). Simply breathtaking.
tt0167261,"Epic battles, spectacular effects and multiple story lines make The Two Towers a most excellent middle chapter in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy."
tt0167261,"A rousing adventure, a skillful marriage of special effects and computer animation, and it contains sequences of breathtaking beauty. It also gives us, in a character named the Gollum, one of the most engaging and convincing CGI creatures I've seen."
tt0167261,"This second installment is heavy on battle sequences, which will thrill some viewers more than others."
tt1375666,"In terms of sheer originality, ambition and achievement, Inception is the movie of the summer, the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams."
tt1375666,"If Inception is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's filmmaking -- an activity devoted to constructing a simulacrum of reality, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave a lasting impression. Mission accomplished."
tt1375666,"With physics-defying, thunderous action, heart-wringing emotion and an astonishing performance from DiCaprio, Nolan delivers another true original: welcome to an undiscovered country."
tt1375666,"In a summer of remakes, reboots and sequels comes Inception, easily the most original movie idea in ages."
tt1375666,"In this wildly ingen­ious chess game, grandmaster Nolan plants ideas in our heads that disturb and dazzle. The result is a knockout. But be warned: Inception dreams big. How cool is that?"
tt1375666,"As engrossing and logic-resistant as the state of dreaming it seeks to replicate, Christopher Nolan's audacious new creation demands further study to fully absorb the multiple, simultaneous stories Nolan finagles into one narrative experience."
tt1375666,"Inception, though, is no ""Avatar""--instead, it’s the movie that many wanted ""Avatar"" to be. In a roaringly fast first hour, we’re introduced to a new technology that allows for the bodily invasion of another person’s dreamworld."
tt1375666,"Inception is an elegant, portentous ride, though I’m not sure Nolan is any closer to visualizing the real (dream) deal than Hitchcock was."
tt1375666,Inception manages to be clunky and confusing on four separate levels of reality.
tt1375666,It's obvious that Nolan either can't articulate or doesn't believe in a distinction between living feelings and dreams--and his barren Inception doesn't capture much of either.
tt0080684,"The best of three Star Wars films, and the most thought-provoking. After the space opera cheerfulness of the original film, this one plunges into darkness and even despair, and surrenders more completely to the underlying mystery of the story. It is because of the emotions stirred in Empire that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third. This is the heart."
tt0080684,"The storyline is more interesting and ambitious, the characters -- little more than appealing types in the original -- are allowed to grow and develop, the special effects are more mature, and the tone is deliciously dark and downbeat. [Special Edition]"
tt0080684,"The balance between action and mysticism in The Empire Strikes Back provides fascinating energy. It's as if the kids are given one set of delights, the bravado of battles and elaborate warships zooming through exotic space, and adults are given another, a layered explanation of what it all means in the grand scheme of things. [Special Edition]"
tt0080684,"It balances bloodshed with charm, spectacle with childlike glee. It's a near flawless movie of its kind."
tt0080684,Technical virtuosity and entertainment ingenuity.
tt0080684,"It was incredible to see what is arguably the best of the Star Wars films, on the big screen again. However, I do not believe that any of the minor changes make the film any better. [Special Edition]"
tt0080684,"This is the bluest film you'll ever see. The haunting color resounds throughout Empire like a sustained, melancholy chord...Empire is essential viewing for lovers of science fiction. [Special Edition]"
tt0080684,"A darker, richer, and more elaborate film than the original; it suffers most from being just what it is: a middle chapter with no real ending. [Special Edition]"
tt0080684,"The Empire Strikes Back is not a truly terrible movie. It's a nice movie. It's not, by any means, as nice as ""Star Wars."" It's not as fresh and funny and surprising and witty, but it is nice and inoffensive and, in a way that no one associated with it need be ashamed of, it's also silly."
tt0080684,"Mainly it's marking time: the characters take a definite backseat to the special effects, and much of the action seems gratuitous, leading nowhere."
tt0133093,"The Matrix slams you back in your chair, pops open your eyes and leaves your jaw hanging slack in amazement."
tt0133093,"The Wachowskis do it so playfully well, keeping The Matrix's potentially confusing plot intelligible, intelligent, and suspenseful, that it doesn't matter."
tt0133093,"Bill Pope's swooping, noir-inflected cinematography is wonderfully complemented by Owen Paterson's inventive production design, a great soundtrack and the best fight choreography this side of Hong Kong. And even if this isn't ""Blade Runner,"" it is very cool shit."
tt0133093,"Kinetic, atmospheric, visually stunning, and mind-bending."
tt0133093,"There's a kind of liberating, almost transforming energy in this film; it lights you up and sends you out all giddy with silliness."
tt0133093,"Doesn't just raise the bar on sci-fi and action films, it rips that sucker off and sends it spiraling into the sun."
tt0133093,"The plot switches gears every time it threatens to run out of energy, which keeps the show as lively as it is preposterous."
tt0133093,"Aerves up so much visual wizardry and thought-provoking ideas that even the inevitable Silver touch -- a finale with more bullets than the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"" -- can't destroy the magic."
tt0133093,It may bore you to death or blow your mind -- and it's long and convoluted enough to do both -- but it holds nothing back.
tt0133093,"There's not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome."
tt0099685,"All of the performances are first-rate; Pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. GoodFellas is easily one of the year's best films. [21 September 1990, Friday, p.C]"
tt0099685,"Director Martin Scorsese's spectacular, irreverent picture."
tt0099685,"Martin Scorsese scores again with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's best-selling ""Wiseguy."""
tt0099685,"Stunningly acted. [21 September 1990, The Arts, p.12]"
tt0099685,"No finer film has ever been made about organized crime - not even ""The Godfather."""
tt0099685,"One of Martin Scorsese's most brutal but stunning movies, an incredible, relentless experience about the singleminded pursuit of crime."
tt0099685,"Ferocious brutality is presented without commentary or judgment, yet with unmistakable moral understanding and vision. [21 September 1990, Daily Notebook p.E-1]"
tt0099685,An appalling masterpiece.
tt0099685,"Simultaneously fascinating and repellent, Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's colorful but dramatically unsatisfying inside look at Mafia life in 1955-1980 New York City."
tt0099685,"Scorsese's style, fierce as it is, doesn't accomplish what he clearly expected of it. Often, in many arts, fresh treatment can redeem familiar subjects, but it doesn't happen here. [Oct 22, 1990]"
tt0073486,"Too many classic set pieces to mention but keep your ears cocked for that immortal line ""Mmmm, Juicy Fruit."" Certified brilliance."
tt0073486,"A masterpiece. (9 Jan 1998, p.3D)"
tt0073486,Brilliant cinema theatre.
tt0073486,"Playing the mental-hospital firebrand who rebels against monstrous Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), Nicholson seduces in an anti-establishment classic with a gut-punch exit."
tt0073486,Here is the bruised-plum role that put Jack Nicholson into the biggest of big leagues.
tt0073486,"With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Forman takes his rightful place as one of our most creative young directors. His casting is inspired, his sense of milieu is assured, and he could probably wring Academy Award performances from a stone."
tt0073486,Jarring and electrifying drama.
tt0073486,"So good in so many of its parts that there's a temptation to forgive it when it goes wrong. But it does go wrong, insisting on making larger points than its story really should carry, so that at the end, the human qualities of the characters get lost in the significance of it all. And yet there are those moments of brilliance."
tt0073486,This slick and entertaining 1975 film of Ken Kesey's cult novel will inevitably disappoint admirers of director Milos Forman's earlier work.
tt0073486,"A comedy that can't quite support its tragic conclusion, which is too schematic to be honestly moving, but it is acted with such a sense of life that one responds to its demonstration of humanity if not to its programmed metaphors."
tt0114369,"It's intriguing, appalling, savvy, nasty, grossly unsettling -- you may not like what you see, but you'll definitely be affected by the sight."
tt0114369,"A dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller."
tt0114369,This homicide thriller has a tantalizingly morbid atmosphere of unease.
tt0114369,"While Seven lacks the cleverness of the superior ""Usual Suspects,"" it's strong enough to hold its own against most other thrillers."
tt0114369,It's not the identity of the killer that gives Seven its kick -- it's the way Fincher raises mystery to the level of moral provocation.
tt0114369,"Director David Fincher shovels on more gloom than even the serial killer genre can sustain in the murkily moody, but self-defeating, Seven."
tt0114369,"It is very tiresome peering through the gloom trying to catch a glimpse of something interesting, then having to avert one's eyes when it turns out to be just another brutally tormented body."
tt0114369,"Watching Seven is like cracking open a safe, only to find it crawling with eels"
tt0114369,"A style so chic, studied and murky it resembles a cross between a Nike commercial and a bad Polish art film."
tt0114369,"Not even bags of body parts, a bitten-off tongue or a man forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh keep it from being dull. [22 September 1995, p. C18]"
tt0038650,"It's one of those ageless movies, like ""Casablanca"" or ""The Third Man,"" that improves with age. Some movies, even good ones, should only be seen once. When we know how they turn out, they've surrendered their mystery and appeal. Other movies can be viewed an indefinite number of times. Like great music, they improve with familiarity. It's a Wonderful Life falls in the second category."
tt0038650,"This couldn't be other than a Capra picture, the humanness of its story the dominant factor at every turn of situation. His direction of the individual characterizations delivered is also distinctively his, and the performances, from the starring roles of James Stewart and Donna Reed down to the smallest bit, are magnificent. When Capra is at his best, no one can top him."
tt0038650,The film is gripping enough simply with the telling of George's lifestory. A genuine American classic.
tt0038650,"Whether you view this film in the middle of the summer or at Christmas, Capra's greatest film represents one of the most transcendent and joyful experiences any movie-lover can hope for."
tt0038650,"Although peppered with colourful, sharply drawn characters, this is Stewart's movie, instantly loveable as a small town dreamer who sacrifices everything for others. His journey to despair and back warms the cockles like little else. Enjoy it in a cinema so you can sob among others."
tt0038650,"The inspirational, thoroughly festive ending is guaranteed to bring tears to the eyes."
tt0038650,"Frank Capra and James Stewart, in returning to films after long years in uniform, endow the pic with its most telling contributions. Herewith, Stewart touches the thespic peak of his career. He hasn’t lost a whit of his erstwhile boyish personality (when called to turn it on) and further shows a maturity and depth he seems recently to have acquired."
tt0038650,"The film is too sprawling in extent, too noisy as to background music and voices and much too obvious in the application of its social significance notes. But while it isn’t the best picture to come out of Hollywood this year, nor is it Capra’s masterpiece, it tells a good story and its conclusion has a heart-warming effect on the audience."
tt0038650,"Without overlooking It’s a Wonderful Life‘s lapses into populist bathos, it’s necessary to rescue the Frank Capra film from its status as an untouchable American “classic.”"
tt0038650,"Indeed, the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer's point of view, is the sentimentality of it—its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra's nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow they all resemble theatrical attitudes rather than average realities. And Mr. Capra's ""turkey dinners"" philosophy, while emotionally gratifying, doesn't fill the hungry paunch."
tt0047478,"Moves like hot mercury, and it draws a viewer so thoroughly into its world that real life can seem thick and dull when the lights come up."
tt0047478,"Much imitated, still unsurpassed. By critical consensus one of the best movies ever made, The Seven Samurai covers so much emotional, historical, and cinematic ground that that it demands to be viewed over and over again."
tt0047478,"The legendary Mifune leads a superb cast, and Kurosawa's kinetic camera keeps the adventure sizzling with energy and wit from start to finish."
tt0047478,It's impossible to imagine how the action genre would have developed without Akira Kurosawa's watershed 1954 movie Seven Samurai.
tt0047478,The glorious vigour and strength of this film is presented with such theatrical relish and flair: its energy flashes out of the screen like a sword.
tt0047478,"Rich in detail, vivid in characterization, leisurely in exposition, this 207-minute epic is bravura filmmaking -- a brilliant yet facile synthesis of Hollywood pictorialism, Soviet montage, and Japanese theatricality that could be a B western transposed to Mars."
tt0047478,"On that simple framework and familiar story line, director Kurosawa has plastered a wealth of rich detail, which brilliantly illuminates his characters and the kind of action in which they are involved. He has loaded his film with unusual and exciting physical incidents and made the whole thing graphic in a hard, realistic western style."
tt0102926,A mesmerizing thriller that will grip audiences from first scene to last.
tt0102926,"The interplay between Starling and Lector as they share an indefinable, dark understanding gives the film its unforgettable and unsettling power. [14 February 1991, Daily Notebook, p.E1]"
tt0102926,"The superbly crafted suspense thriller&#133;slams you like a sudden blast of bone-chilling, pulse-pounding terror."
tt0102926,"A movie with this kind of haunting power comes along only once every decade or so. [20 February 1991, Life, p.11D]"
tt0102926,"Hopkins plays the cannibalistic doctor with a quiet, controlled erudition, lacing his performance with moments of black humor. His Lecter is a sort of satanic Sherlock Holmes whose spasms of violence are all the more terrifying because they erupt from beneath such an intelligent and refined mask."
tt0102926,"A smart, restrained entertainment, it doesn't splash around in blood and hysteria. It doesn't have to."
tt0102926,It has been a good long while since I have felt the presence of Evil so manifestly demonstrated as in the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs.
tt0102926,"An accomplished, effective, grisly, and exceptionally sick slasher film that I can't with any conscience recommend, because the purposes to which it places its considerable ingenuity are ultimately rather foul."
tt0102926,"Demme's pacing is tight throughout, marred only by some low-angle close-ups of the cannibal that are right out of old Vincent Price thrillers. [Feb 18, 1991]"
tt0102926,"Billed as one of the most frightening, depraved films ever made. Would that it were so. Instead, this is a case of much ado about nothing. [15 February 1991, Friday, p.C]"
tt0120815,An overwhelming experience.
tt0120815,"A war film that, entirely aware of its genre's conventions, transcends them as it transcends the simplistic moralities that inform its predecessors, to take the high, morally haunting ground."
tt0120815,"Spectacular, wrenching masterpiece that unflinchingly documents the random horror, the grisly spectacle and the ugliness of war."
tt0120815,The effect is riveting and frightening. You feel you are under siege with the combatants.
tt0120815,A magnificent piece of movie-making.
tt0120815,"A bitter, bloody masterpiece with adrenalized emotions and hyper-realized images, this is perhaps as close to battle as any sane human being should ever hope to tread."
tt0120815,The movie's greatest strength lies in phenomenal performances that reach from the leads right down to the smallest supporting roles.
tt0120815,"If Steven Spielberg's emotional intelligence matched his visual genius, his honorably flawed new film might qualify for one of the greatest-ever American WWII movies."
tt0120815,"Steven Spielberg's new film begins as a monumental epic; then it diminishes; and, by its finish, is baffling. [August 24, 1998]"
tt0120815,"Nothing that suggests an independent vision, unless you count seeing more limbs blown off than usual."
tt0317248,"The film is seductive, disturbing, enthralling -- a trip to hell that gives the passengers a great ride."
tt0317248,Like a bomb exploding in a fireworks factory: It's fierce and shocking and dazzling and wonderful.
tt0317248,A marvelous achievement that refuses to avert its gaze from the poetry and the insane savagery of the hopeless.
tt0317248,"As the movie's frenetic visual rhythms and mood swings synchronize with the zany, adrenaline-fueled impulsiveness of its lost youth on the rampage, you may find yourself getting lost in this teeming netherworld."
tt0317248,It takes a strong stomach to sit through its two-plus hours of non-stop brutality (much of it involving very small children).
tt0317248,"A potent and unexpected mixture of authenticity and flash -- even if this is what happened on the ground, making it worth our time on screen is just beyond the contortionist abilities of even this most acrobatic of films."
tt0317248,"Meirelles's picture is so keen to brandish its social wrath, and its spirits are so rampagingly high, that the bruises it inflicts barely last a night. [20 January 2003, p. 94]"
tt0317248,"Full of action, but no soul."
tt0317248,"In its cinematic approach, though, the film is as slick as any Hollywood thriller, directed by Fernando Meirelles with visual flourishes - jazzy editing, lurid colors, crackling sound effects - that dilute the impact of what might have been an indelible cautionary tale."
tt0317248,"Undeniably powerful, but also rather numbing."
tt0816692,An exhilarating slalom through the wormholes of Christopher Nolan’s vast imagination that is at once a science-geek fever dream and a formidable consideration of what makes us human.
tt0816692,"It’s a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike, and yet it always feels grounded in its own deadly serious reality."
tt0816692,Interstellar is Nolan’s best and most brazenly ambitious film to date.
tt0816692,"Brainy and exciting at the same time, Interstellar invalidates the need for mindless Hollywood product. No matter its shortcomings, the movie achieves an impressive balancing act. It turns the mysteries of the universe into a cinematic playground, but for every profound or visually arresting moment, it also encourages you to to think."
tt0816692,"I was moved by Interstellar, and there are stretches where it is as good and as pure as anything Nolan's made. You can feel just how important all of it is to him in every frame of the thing. I don't love all of the film's dramatic choices, though."
tt0816692,"This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that."
tt0816692,"Nolan reaches for the stars in spectacular fashion, delivering a mesmerising sci-fi epic that, despite a testing running time and few too many flights of fancy, is grounded by an on-form McConaughey."
tt0816692,"It’s a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour. It wants to awe us into submission, to concede our insignificance in the face of such grand-scale art. It achieves that with ease. Yet on his way to making an epic, Nolan forgot to let us have fun."
tt0816692,"For much of the film, Nolan (who co-wrote with his brother Jonathan) seems to be unafraid to allow this big-budget extravaganza to tell a story that's about pain and loss and melancholy and sacrifice. Until it's not that anymore, and Interstellar becomes thuddingly prosaic."
tt0816692,"Promising outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick's “2001: A Space Odyssey,” Interstellar instead plays like a confused mix of daringly unique space-travel footage like you’ve never seen and droningly familiar emotional and plot beats that you’ve seen all too many times before."
tt0118799,"Benigni, with great help from young Cantarini, has crafted a work of such complexity that you may find both your brain and your heart simply overloaded. Which, of course, is the rarely achieved goal of all art."
tt0118799,Its unique message about laughing in the face of evil clearly reveals that life is beautiful.
tt0118799,"Benigni effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. And he draws from this an unpretentious, enormously likable film that plays with history both seriously and mischievously. Piety has no place here, nor do tears until the final reel. Life is Beautiful plays by its own rules"
tt0118799,"The concept is not so much nihilistic as it is realistic, and the fact that Benigni has made such fine distinctions so powerfully clear is amazing and moving."
tt0118799,"While most reviewers will accuse it of sentimentality (a charge that is justified), audiences, who don't feel the need to appear rigorous and tough-minded all the time, will flock to it in droves."
tt0118799,Starts out as sentimental whimsy and ends as sentimental kitsch.
tt0118799,Benigni sets out to do the impossible.
tt0118799,"Has good intentions, but its exaggerated celebration of quick-witted improvisation ultimately trivializes the human and historical horrors evoked by the story."
tt0118799,The indifference of the proceedings and the hero's slapstick behavior to the everyday realities of the camps borders on the nauseating.
tt0118799,Benigni's movie made me want to throw up.
tt0120689,"So moving, so memorable, so magically produced, it's going to delight millions of movie fans and sweep the Oscars."
tt0120689,"Darabont follows King's book fairly closely, allowing the audience to steep itself in the setting and characters slowly, like reading a good novel."
tt0120689,"There's almost too much there, but the three-hour-plus film permits the kind of detailing that not only brings the storytelling to life, but sometimes persuades us we're breathing to its rhythms."
tt0120689,"An often pedestrian film, one that never inflates to the epic grandeur to which it aspires or transfers its own emotional trajectory off the screen and into the viewer."
tt0120689,"Excessive, but I, like Mr. Jingles, can't resist the Christmas-season cheese."
tt0120689,"A very engrossing movie, the kind that gives shameless manipulation a good name."
tt0120689,"A film with a counterproductive tendency to take its time...but unassumingly strong, moving performances and Darabont's durable storytelling make it a trip worth taking just the same."
tt0120689,Surely a life sentence goes by quicker.
tt0120689,"Its view of spiritual healing is closer to Spielberg fantasy than religious insight. Still, its good acting and good intentions will be enough to please many viewers."
tt0120689,Simply a case of severe overreaching and the illusion that an overstuffed movie is an epic movie.
tt0076759,"An exhilarating update of ""Flash Gordon,"" very much in the same half-jokey, half-earnest mood, but backed by special effects that, for once, really work and are intelligently integrated with the story."
tt0076759,"If I were asked to say with certainty which movies will still be widely known a century or two from now, I would list ""2001,'' ""The Wizard of Oz,'' Keaton and Chaplin, Astaire and Rogers, and probably ""Casablanca'' ... and ""Star Wars,'' for sure."
tt0076759,"Like all great craftsmen, Lucas has managed to fashion this material in a manner that not only honors the original sources, but makes it uniquely his own. Hacks rip off other movies; artists synthesize and pay homage to their inspirations."
tt0076759,"Star Wars, set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” is the most exciting picture to be released this year — exciting as theater and exciting as cinema. It is the most visually awesome such work to appear since “2001: A Space Odyssey,” yet is intriguingly human in its scope and boundaries."
tt0076759,"A marvelous child of Star Wars technology, the advanced sound design makes a celebratory re-viewing of George Lucas' legendary, 20-year-old space opera a thrilling experience. [Special Edition]"
tt0076759,"A magnificent film. George Lucas set out to make the biggest possible adventure fantasy out of his memories of serials and older action epics, and he succeeded brilliantly."
tt0076759,"Star Wars brought back for a new generation many of the most attractive elements of studio-era moviemaking, and it did so in breathless anthology form. For some young filmgoers this film acted as a doorway to the glory of the movies."
tt0076759,"Let's discuss those extra four minutes for a second, shall we? I found them incredibly distracting. [Special Edition]"
tt0076759,"Everyone treats his material with the proper combination of solemnity and good humor that avoids condescension. One of Mr. Lucas's particular achievements is the manner in which he is able to recall the tackiness of the old comic strips and serials he loves without making a movie that is, itself, tacky."
tt0076759,"Still packs an entertaining punch with its blend of old-movie formulas, new-age philosophies, and video-game visuals. A small amount of new material, added for the 20th-anniversary reissue, is fun to look for but doesn't make much difference to the story or its impact. [Special Edition]"
tt0103064,"A great movie... A pop epiphany, marking that commercially creative point where the power of Hollywood meets the purity of myth."
tt0103064,"More elaborate than the original, but just as shrewdly put together, it cleverly combines the most successful elements of its predecessor with a number of new twists (would you believe a kinder, gentler Terminator?) to produce on e hell of a wild ride, a Twilight of the Gods that takes no prisoners and leaves audiences desperate for mercy. [3 July 1991, Calendar, p.F-1]"
tt0103064,"Terminator 2 imagines things you wouldn't even be likely to dream and gets these visions onto the screen with a seamlessness that's mind-boggling. [3 July 1991, Daily Datebook, p.E1]"
tt0103064,"The key element in any action picture, I think, is a good villain. Terminator 2 has one, along with an intriguing hero and fierce heroine, and a young boy who is played by Furlong with guts and energy."
tt0103064,"As with ""Aliens,"" director James Cameron has again taken a first rate science fiction film and crafted a sequel that's in some ways more impressive - expanding on the original rather than merely remaking it."
tt0103064,"Arnie is Arnie. He has all the cute lines (""No problemo,"" ""Hasta la vista, baby''). And he does more with a squint than anyone since Popeye. [3 July 1991, Life, p.1D]"
tt0103064,Trend-setting visuals compensate for a plot that lacks the imagination and edge of the 1984 original.
tt0103064,"What is notable, though, is the amount of compassion invested in the film by Cameron and co-screenwriter William Wisher. There's a fairly well-drawn moral message in T2 that was more or less absent in the first film."
tt0103064,"All the virtues of the original... are present here, though when Cameron tries to milk some sentiment out of the ""personality"" and fate of his top machine he comes up flat and empty, and the other characters are scarcely more interesting."
tt0103064,"The surprise is that a picture made to be exciting for 136 minutes is so unexciting most of the time. It starts with a bang and keeps banging, so there's little suspense and no crescendo. [12 Aug 1991, p.28]"
tt0088763,"The best mainstream film since ""E.T.,"" is an uplifting reminder that Hollywood can still produce truly great entertainment...The plot is so exquisitely developed that divulging anything beyond the basic outline might diminish the joyous surprises that await an audience thirsting for originality in a reactionary medium. [03 July 1985, p.57]"
tt0088763,"So what we have in the middle of Back to the Future, this seeming kids' movie full of screeching cars, special effects and lightning storms, is nothing less than an adult reverie. And if families could be persuaded to see this film together, it might touch off a long night of sharing between parents and children. [03 July 1985]"
tt0088763,"This brilliant contraption of a film could become the hit of the summer. It's a cinematic Rube Goldberg machine whose parts connect in audacious, witty ways. [04 July 1985, p.E.1]"
tt0088763,"Back to the Future doesn't exactly leap out of the starting gate, and some scenes are strung out by gimmicky editing. But the story picks up steam as it goes along, and the last third is especially full of speedy surprises. [3 July 1985, p.23]"
tt0088763,"Mr. Zemeckis is able both to keep the story moving and to keep it from going too far. He handles Back to the Future with the kind of inventiveness that indicates he will be spinning funny, whimsical tall tales for a long time to come."
tt0088763,"Performances by the earnest Fox, the lunatic Lloyd, the deceptively passionate Lea Thompson, and, particularly, the bumbling-to-confident Glover, who runs away with the picture, merrily keep the ship sailing."
tt0088763,"The movie, in fact, resembles Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" more than other, conventional time-travel movies."
tt0088763,"I just don't know how all this sweetness and light will go down with a teenaged movie audience presumably gung-ho with Rambo - especially now that he's got the presidential seal of approval. And that's no joke, son! [3 July 1985, p.58]"
tt0088763,"For girls and boys who like games, ideas and toys, Back to the Future probably is worth an afternoon's good giggle. But baby boomers be forewarned: You had a better guffaw at Son of Flubber! [3 July 1985, p.D9]"
tt0088763,"It's big, cartoonish and empty, with an interesting premise that is underdeveloped and overproduced. [3 July 1985, p.Calendar 6]"
tt0245429,A visual masterpiece about a scared little girl's breathtaking journey of self-discovery. All of the fun is getting there.
tt0245429,"Yet its visual surrealism, identity-bending and strong social/ecological message make it as much an allegory as a fable."
tt0245429,"Turns everything we know about the contemporary world on its head, and substitutes it with one in which spirits, monsters, magicians and animals mix it up in a carnival of energy, good humor and freewheeling illusion."
tt0245429,"Probably like nothing you've ever seen before. In a cool world, it would be guaranteed not only the Best Animated Feature Oscar, but Best Picture as well."
tt0245429,Serenely stunning.
tt0245429,Wondrously strange and just plain wonderful.
tt0245429,"A Japanese cross between ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" -- is such a landmark in animation that labeling it a masterpiece almost seems inadequate."
tt0245429,"It will disturb you as much as thrill you, make you wonder whether the boundaries between life and death, reality and fantasy, imagination and insanity are ever what they appear to be."
tt0245429,"A very nutty fruitcake, Spirited Away is characterized by wonderfully detailed animation, packed with incident and populated by all manner of comic creatures."
tt0245429,It's a movie full of bewitching images and timeless fun and beauty.
tt0253474,"Polanski, himself a survivor of Nazi-occupied Poland, has created a near-masterpiece."
tt0253474,"There are three Poles in The Pianist -- Szpilman, Polanski, and Frederic Chopin. Of the three, fittingly, Chopin speaks the loudest."
tt0253474,"The result is a movie, and Cannes Palme d'Or winner, of riveting power and sadness, a great match of film and filmmaker -- and star, too."
tt0253474,"The results are masterful, admirably unsentimental, and never boring, if also a little stodgy."
tt0253474,"This powerful, precision-made movie offers hope as well -- an act of kindness from a German officer that saves the pianist&#146;s life, the music that sustains his soul."
tt0253474,Never before has a fiction film so clearly and to such devastating effect laid out the calculation of the Nazi machinery of death and its irrationality.
tt0253474,"Szpilman takes to performing sonatas in thin air, eyes closed, those jittery fingers stroking nothing but air. It's a wonderful moment in a wonderful, ghastly film, and one of the most moving arguments for the redemptive powers of art ever made."
tt0253474,Polanski's film is an unqualified success both dramatically and artistically.
tt0253474,"To name only one of its predecessors -- for me, the towering one -- doesn't ""Schindler's List"" do everything that Polanski achieves and more?"
tt0253474,"Through Brody's remarkably controlled, self-effacing performance, Polanski succeeds in making his hero an invisible man, but the sights he conjures are surprisingly artless and ordinary, familiar from a dozen other Holocaust dramas. Among the casualties in The Pianist is a great director's imagination."
tt0054215,"What makes Psycho immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten as we leave the theater, is that it connects directly with our fears: Our fears that we might impulsively commit a crime, our fears of the police, our fears of becoming the victim of a madman, and of course our fears of disappointing our mothers."
tt0054215,"Hitchcock's mischievous genius for audience manipulation is everywhere: in the noirish angularity of the cinematography, in his use of Bernard Herrmann's stabbing string score, in the ornithological imagery that creates a bizarre sense of preying and being preyed upon."
tt0054215,"Felt in the full impact of a theatrical screening (with the pleasure of seeing patrons reflexively kick or stiffen at the sight of Miles startled by her mirrored reflection), its power is not just that of a showman’s calibrated scare machine, but of a somber fugue on the trapped 20th-century creatures who inhabit its world, clawing but never budging an inch."
tt0054215,Timeless classic. Superb performances and the infamous shower scene make this the perfect nightmare.
tt0054215,"Psycho, in its dark and sordid extravagance, remains utterly contemporary, in its subject as well as in its production."
tt0054215,"The obvious thing to say is that Hitch has done it again; that the suspense of his picture builds up slowly but surely to an almost unbearable pitch of excitement. Psycho is a murder mystery. It isn’t Hitchcock’s usual terrifier, a shocker of the nervous system; it’s a mind-teaser."
tt0054215,"Perkins gives a remarkably effective in-a-dream kind of performance as the possessed young man. Others play it straight, with equal competence."
tt0054215,"Psycho is a brilliant excursion into fear that pushes many of our primal buttons, but it lacks the story and character complexity of Vertigo and Rear Window."
tt0054215,"The consequence in his denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair. Mr. Perkins and Miss Leigh perform with verve, and Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam do well enough in other roles."
tt0054215,"What is offered instead is merely gruesome. The trail leads to a sagging, swamp-view motel and to one of the messiest, most nau seating murders ever filmed. At close range, the camera watches every twitch, gurgle, convulsion and hemorrhage in the process by which a living human becomes a corpse...The nightmare that follows is expertly gothic, but the nausea never disappears."
tt6751668,A masterful dissection of social inequality and the psychology of money.
tt6751668,"Parasite begins in exhilaration and ends in devastation, but the triumph of the movie is that it fully lives and breathes at every moment, even when you might find yourself struggling to exhale."
tt6751668,A raucous and blood-splattered social satire.
tt6751668,"[A] furious and fiendishly well-crafted new film. ... Giddy one moment, unbearably tense the next, and always so entertaining and fine-tuned that you don’t even notice when it’s changing gears, “Parasite” takes all of the beats you expect to find in a Bong film and shrinks them down with clockwork precision."
tt6751668,"Parasite is a malign delight from start to finish, with a Machiavellian sense of mischief and a cinematic brio that shows Bong revelling in his Hitchcockian control of somewhat Buñuelian material."
tt6751668,"Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture, which takes bold leaps between tenors and tone, but holds together beautifully thanks to the director’s unparalleled visual/spatial sophistication, and his unsparing social indictment."
tt6751668,"Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so 2019: Parasite is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage."
tt6751668,A luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama.
tt6751668,"A demented and often-uproarious class-conscious satire, Parasite falls slightly short of Bong’s greatest work."
tt6751668,"Like much of Bong’s work, Parasite is cumbersomely plotted and heavy-handed in its social commentary. The largely naturalistic treatment here may also alienate some of his fantasy fanboy constituency. That said, this prickly contemporary drama still feels more coherent and tonally assured than Snowpiercer or Okja, and packs a timely punch that will resonate in our financially tough, politically polarized times."
tt0110413,"Ah, monsieur, you can lead a Frenchman to the Big Apple, but you can't make him a New Yorker -- and that's exactly what makes The Professional so fascinating."
tt0110413,"Oldman is the least inhibited actor of his generation, and as this deranged detective, he keeps absolutely nothing in reserve."
tt0110413,Few action films can claim such complexities without conceding the bang-bang stuff that brings in the big money.
tt0110413,"Besson's visuals are, as always, vibrant and decidedly European. He fills the frames with odd-angled shots and alarming riots of color that catch you off-balance."
tt0110413,"With some surprisingly strong character interaction, there's a lot to like about this movie, at least for those willing to look beyond all the bloodshed."
tt0110413,"This is a Cuisinart of a movie, mixing familiar yet disparate ingredients, making something odd, possibly distasteful, undeniably arresting out of them. [5 Dec 1994, p. 93]"
tt0110413,Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style.
tt0110413,"Takes its viewers on a bouncing high-wire act between intense violence and sugar-sweet tenderness, with some light-hearted comedy along the way."
tt0110413,"The sheer oddness of the New York world constructed for this film--where cops and crooks are literally interchangeable, and Oldman and Danny Aiello are stranded in roles that pick over the leavings of earlier parts--ultimately seems at once too deranged and too mechanical."
tt0110413,"Lacks the sexy elan of ""La Femme Nikita"" and suffers from infinitely worse culture shock. [18 Nov 1994, p.C18]"
tt0172495,It's a stunning Roman triumph.
tt0172495,"What matters for today's hero is the good fight, and Gladiator KOs us with a doozy."
tt0172495,"An exhilarating, sweeping epic that begs to be seen on the largest possible screen."
tt0172495,"Lacks emotional depth and sweep -- but the movie still delivers the type of rousing, large-scale adventure that marked the best films of its kind"
tt0172495,The heroism and the tigers and the epic grandeur all leave behind the flavor of cynicism.
tt0172495,"It epitomizes the kind of high-profile bloodshed we now expect to herald the hazy, lazy, blockbuster-fixated days of summer."
tt0172495,"The script by producer David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson is serviceable but not exactly inspired."
tt0172495,"Filled with brilliant filmmaking and features outstanding performances, but it's neither profound enough nor pop enough to be great -- it's mournful, serious, beautiful and, finally, pointless."
tt0172495,"Like an aging athlete who knows how to husband strength and camouflage weaknesses, it makes the most of what it does well and hopes you won't notice its limitations."
tt0172495,"It's a loud, obnoxious, and pleasant-enough entertainment, but hardly the soaring tale of one man's struggle that it was so clearly envisioned to be."
tt0110357,"Pure, eye-popping pleasure."
tt0110357,Has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie.
tt0110357,"A timeless classic, full of excitement, humor, witty asides and memorable characters."
tt0110357,"This is the Mickey Mouse factory at its finest, with inventive animation, stirring music and a pride of inspired, almost-human animals."
tt0110357,"There are moments of fun and humor, to be sure, but the undercurrent is of a far more serious, ""adult"" nature. The Lion King is primarily about guilt and redemption."
tt0110357,A dazzling -- and unexpectedly daring -- addition to the Disney canon.
tt0110357,It's a thumping good adventure.
tt0110357,"For all the undeniable merits, it somehow feels manufactured, and thus, to a degree, calculated - the product not of a collective imagination taking esthetic chances, but of an imaginative collective putting the rivets into a well-wrought plan that can't go awry."
tt0110357,"The result is a step toward multiculturalism and ecological correctness, though not without a certain amount of confusion. The movie is not quite as entertaining as The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast."
tt0110357,"Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange."
tt0120586,"Feels as true as a documentary, as painful as a blow to the heart."
tt0120586,"Jolting, superbly acted film."
tt0120586,"A true achievement -- no matter who eventually wants to take, or deny, credit for its creation."
tt0120586,An inflated yet gut-slugging film.
tt0120586,"While this movie is sometimes overbaked, it is the first major studio release in a while to engross wall-to-wall."
tt0120586,"The movie can't explain as much as it wants to about what makes (and unmakes) a skinhead, but it carries us a fair distance."
tt0120586,"Trenchant and visceral, American History X may not be perfect, but it's a darn sight better than good."
tt0120586,"For all its surface verisimilitude and for all its focus on a problem that couldn't be more current, this film can't manage to feel more than sporadically real."
tt0120586,"As a visit to a world and a way of life most of us will never experience, American History X is vivid, and it feels honest. At the very least, it's not typical."
tt0120586,A mess of a film.
tt0407887,"A new American crime classic from the legendary Martin Scorsese, whose talent shines here on its highest beams."
tt0407887,A ferociously entertaining film.
tt0407887,"The Departed is Scorsese's most purely enjoyable movie in years. But it's not for the faint of heart. It's rude, bleak, violent and defiantly un-PC. But if you doubt that it's also OK to laugh throughout this rat's nest of paranoia, deceit and bloodshed, keep your eyes on the final frames. Scorsese's parting shot is an uncharacteristic, but well-earned, wink."
tt0407887,"The original film was gritty and entertaining (""Infernal Affairs""); the new version is a masterpiece - the best effort Scorsese has brought to the screen since ""Goodfellas."""
tt0407887,A triumphant revisiting of territory in which Scorsese is an unchallenged master -- the crime drama.
tt0407887,"The very title The Departed suggests a James Joycean take on Irish-Catholic sentiment when, of course, this story is anything but: It's Scorsesean, and he's in full bloom."
tt0407887,"This reworking of a popular Hong Kong picture pulses with energy, tangy dialogue and crackling performances from a fine cast."
tt0407887,"The movie works smashingly, especially if you haven't seen its Hong Kong counterpart and haven't a clue what's coming. But for all its snap, crackle, and pop, it's nowhere near as galvanic emotionally."
tt0407887,"Back to the streets and with a stellar cast, Martin Scorsese proves once again that he's the master of urban storytelling -- and of thrillingly violent filmmaking."
tt0407887,"Neither a debacle nor a bore, The Departed works but only up to a point, and never emotionally--even if the director does contrive to supply his version of a happy ending."
tt2582802,"However genius may flourish, you know it when you see it, and Whiplash is it."
tt2582802,"Although a couple of narrative twists late on threaten to drum us into melodrama, Chazelle never misses a beat and the film builds to a cathartic crescendo."
tt2582802,"Revealing both the dangers and payoffs of artistic ambition, Whiplash is sure to establish Chazelle as a directorial force to be reckoned with."
tt2582802,"Chazelle proves an exceptional builder of scenes, crafting loaded, need-to-succeed moments that grab our attention and hold it tight."
tt2582802,The thrill of watching Fletcher and Neyman's fray unfold is intensified by Damien Chazelle's attention to the craft and challenge of musicianship.
tt2582802,"[An] unusually unromantic approach to music education is one of many noteworthy things about Whiplash, a funny, exhilarating drama — bordering on psychological thriller."
tt2582802,"The quest to be the best is a familiar film story, but if director-writer Chazelle has achieved anything here, it’s a deeply and richly different take on that journey—not only examining the cost of struggle but the reward of it, showing both what it takes to be great and what happens when you don’t have it."
tt2582802,It's rare to see a film about music that professes its love for the music and its characters equally.
tt2582802,"The antithesis of “let’s-put-on-a-show” fluff, Whiplash...is about the wages of all-out sacrifice and commitment."
tt2582802,Whiplash scrapes the far edge of crazy passion. It never apologizes.
tt0482571,"The Prestige isn't art, but it reaps a lot of fun out of the question, How did they do that?"
tt0482571,"Stuffed with hard-working actors, sleek effects and stagy period details, The Prestige, directed by Christopher Nolan from a script he wrote with his brother Jonathan, is an intricate and elaborate machine designed for the simple purpose of diversion."
tt0482571,"The Prestige does more than focus on magicians. It is so in love with the romance, wonder and ability to fool of stage illusion that it becomes something of a magic trick in and of itself"
tt0482571,"Bale and Jackman inject their reliable charisma into two otherwise very cold fish. Okay, I'll say it: If you see only one magic-at-the-turn-of-the-century movie this year, make it this one."
tt0482571,Has its moments.
tt0482571,The result is a lopsided yet absorbing movie in which the director is less drawn to his main characters than to those on the periphery.
tt0482571,"Many, I suspect, will fall for The Prestige and its blend of one-upsmanship and science fiction. I prefer ""The Illusionist,"" the movie that got here first."
tt0482571,"If you can forgive some woeful casting and a plot that is as creakingly thin as an old staircase, you can enjoy director Christopher Nolan's The Prestige."
tt0482571,"Audiences might enjoy this cinematic sleight of hand, but the key characters are such single-minded, calculating individuals that the real magic would be to find any heart in this tale."
tt0482571,"Clearly, director Nolan is aiming for something else. But the delight in sheer gamesmanship that marked his breakout ""Memento"" doesn't survive this project's gimmickry and aspirations toward ""Les Miserables""-style epic passion."
tt0114814,"The Usual Suspects is an ironic, bang-up thriller about the wages of crime. A terrific cast of exciting actors socks over this absorbingly complicated yarn that's been spun in a seductively slick fashion by director Bryan Singer."
tt0114814,"This one's done right. Here's an intelligent movie with no special effects. You have to pay close attention, to listen hard to its cross-fires of dialogue."
tt0114814,"Dense, ironic and thoroughly engrossing caper melodrama."
tt0114814,"The Usual Suspects is an accomplished synthesis of noir elements and, as such, is an entertaining entry to the genre."
tt0114814,"Byrne is a stand-up poet the way some actors are stand-up comics. His innate depth prompts The Usual Suspects to transcend its own cleverness--and this is the movie's smartest, least predictable surprise."
tt0114814,"This thriller is like a game of life-and-death chess, with quick double-crosses and wild gambits."
tt0114814,I liked this film better the second time around.
tt0114814,"Dense with plot intricacies, thick with atmosphere, and packed with showy roles for a hip ensemble."
tt0114814,Self-consciously bleak.
tt0114814,"To the degree that you will want to see this movie, it will be because of the surprise, and so I will say no more, except to say that the ""solution,"" when it comes, solves little - unless there is really little to solve, which is also a possibility."
tt0034583,"The dialogue is so spare and cynical it has not grown old-fashioned. Much of the emotional effect of Casablanca is achieved by indirection; as we leave the theater, we are absolutely convinced that the only thing keeping the world from going crazy is that the problems of three little people do after all amount to more than a hill of beans."
tt0034583,"Much more fun than its stuffy ""Greatest Film Ever Made"" tag suggests, with a literate script, stylish direction, a great song and cinema's most romantic couple in Bogie and Bergman."
tt0034583,"Casablanca accomplishes that which only a truly great film can: enveloping the viewer in the story, forging an unbreakable link with the characters, and only letting go with the end credits."
tt0034583,"The film has a peculiar magic to it, and because of its pace the richness of its sense of detail often goes unnoticed."
tt0034583,"Seventy years on, this great romantic noir is still grippingly powerful: a movie made at a time when it was far from clear the Nazis were going to lose."
tt0034583,"Despite the fact that the fortunate turn or military events has removed the city of Casablanca, in French Morocco, from the Vichyfrance sphere and has thus in one respect dated the film, the combination of fine performances, engrossing story and neat direction make that easily forgotten. Film should be a solid moneymaker everywhere."
tt0034583,"The most familiar movie in the world is still fresh; it has so many little busy corners to nestle in... Casablanca is the most sociable, the most companionable film ever made. Life as an endless party."
tt0034583,"There are some of the very finest character actors that Warner Brothers could muster and a rich, detailed screenplay studded with an indecent number of sparklingly quotable lines. It is a movie to play again, and again."
tt0034583,"Casablanca was filmed in the safety of the Warner Bros. lot, but the cast of immigrants and exiles who had fled the Third Reich conveyed their visceral fear. While the future was uncertain, the resolute characters of this exquisite wartime drama found peace through love and resistance."
tt0034583,Here is a drama that lifts you right out of your seat.
tt0095327,"The movie remains one of the most startling and moving animated films ever. It is also, with the likes of “The 400 Blows,” “Kes,” and “Vagabond,” one of the finest films about being young in an indifferent world."
tt0095327,An emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation.
tt0095327,This animated Japanese masterpiece is a war story as wrenching as any live-action movie.
tt0095327,"While a child might be affected by the film, it takes the weight of a certain number of years to fully absorb what director Isao Takahata has put up on the screen."
tt0095327,"Based on Akiyuki Nosaka's semi-autobiographical novel, Takahata's alternately sweeping and intimate animated feature is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war."
tt0095327,"Fireflies makes its doomed subjects seem utterly human, with the wealth of personal details and believable characterizations common to Studio Ghibli's peerless animated films."
tt0095327,"Isao Takahata makes survival the thematic core of the story, but he never degrades his characters or fetishizes their suffering."
tt0095327,Rivals the films of Hayao Miyazaki in elevating anime to the level of fine art.
tt0095327,"It's an accomplished, affecting, relentless work."
tt0095327,"A devastating heart-stab of a movie, this certainly isn't a family film. It is, however, a beautifully constructed, animated drama."
tt0056058,"Harakiri is a film reflecting situational ethics, in which the better you know a man the more deeply you understand his motives."
tt0056058,"Kobayashi unfolds the grim, cynical tale in layers, climaxing in a brilliant, beautiful swordfight on a wind-swept plain. [05 Dec 2003, p.C1]"
tt0056058,"Kobayashi's great, laceratingly exciting 1962 Japanese samurai revenge saga, once voted by Japanese critics their country's all-time best film. [03 Mar 2006, p.C5]"
tt0056058,"Whilst there is plenty of swordplay involved, it's the war of words and ideals that really captures the imagination here."
tt0056058,"Few swords clash until the 100-minute mark of Harakiri, making it one of the most patient action films ever, but also one of the most beautifully composed. [24 Mar 2006, p.R13]"
tt0056058,"The film has a steady, hypnotic momentum; the director, Masaki Kobayashi, wrings as much drama out of facial twitches as he does out of sword fights. He’s helped immensely by Nakadai’s molten performance and Toru Takemitsu’s spare, disquieting music."
tt0056058,"This stunning film is a sombre tragedy [from Yasuhiko Takiguchi's novel] giving off deep rage against militarism, political systems and beliefs that do not allow for a rational human outlook or future change."
tt0056058,"Structured with intricacy and precision, the storyline alternates between present and past, using its extended flashback sequences to delay and then detonate narrative revelations like so many time bombs."
tt0056058,"You may not get much satisfaction from the tortured human drama in this film, but you should get an eyeful graphic exercise."
tt1675434,Enjoy this movie for what it is - the kind of motion picture that can cause Champaign-like giddiness - and don't obsess over how true-to-life this work of fiction is.
tt1675434,"Let me come clean right now and tell you that I enjoyed The Intouchables quite a bit. If you're looking for a lightweight summer change of pace, with just a smidgen of Continental flair, here it is."
tt1675434,"The power dynamic may charm the French, but it's likely to push the cringe buttons of local moviegoers in Obama's post-""The Green Mile America."" Apart from the wince-inducing moments, The Intouchables is often a pleasant buddy picture."
tt1675434,"Actually, The Intouchables isn't bad - its merely shameless, but at least it's overtly so."
tt1675434,"Sy and Cluzet give their parts more conviction than they deserve, even when the former is forced to re-enact the falsetto-singing-in-the-bubblebath bit from Pretty Woman. But even their energy can't revive a corpse this dead."
tt1675434,"Corny, calculating and commercial...Their slickly executed culture-clash character piece is stuffed chock full of hard-knock life lessons that owe much more to the conventions of the screen than the tough realities of social deprivation and of the severely handicapped."
tt1675434,Cluzet and Sy nonetheless make for ingratiating foils; the extended opening sequence in which the duo outwits a pair of cops like a hell-raising Laurel and Hardy could be a stellar short comedy if it weren't married to the deadly self-serious shtick that follows.
tt1675434,"A cheeky dream-drama about the friendship between a rich, white quadriplegic and a penurious black job-seeker, the premise of The Intouchables alone nearly renders analysis redundant."
tt1675434,"Though never known for their subtlety, French co-helmers/scripters Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache have never delivered a film as offensive as ""Untouchable,"" which flings about the kind of Uncle Tom racism one hopes has permanently exited American screens."
tt1675434,"The plot becomes disastrously condescending: the black man, who's crude, sexy, and a great dancer, liberates the frozen white man. The handsome Omar Sy jumps all over the place, and he's blunt and grating. Francois Cluzet acts with his eyebrows, his nose, his forehead. It's an admirable performance, but the movie is an embarrassment. [28 May 2012, p.78]"
tt0027977,Chaplin's sentimental politics and peerless comic invention dovetailed more perfectly in this film than in any other he made.
tt0027977,"An ungainly masterpiece, but Chaplin's ungainliness is something one can grow fond of."
tt0027977,"Charlie Chaplin finally got around to acknowledging the 20th century in this 1936 film, which substitutes machine-age gags for the fading Victoriana of his other work. Consequently, it's the coldest of his major features, though no less brilliant for it."
tt0027977,Remains Chaplin's most sustained burlesque of authority.
tt0064116,An additional treat is seeing Hollywood good guy Henry Fonda playing one of the nastiest curs in the West. Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the great films in cinema history. (8/30/2000 Review)
tt0064116,"Leone brought back a masterpiece, a film that expands his baroque, cartoonish style into genuine grandeur, weaving dozens of thematic variations and narrative arabesques around a classical western foundation myth.(Review of Original Release)"
tt0064116,"Sergio Leone's masterpiece. In Once Upon a Time in the West, Leone pulls together all the themes, characterizations, visuals, humor, and musical experiments of the three ""Dollars"" films and comes up with a true epic western. It is a stunning, operatic film of breadth, detail, and stature that deserves to be considered among the greatest westerns ever made. (Review of Original Release)"
tt0064116,"Akira Kurosawa once said that Toshiro Mifune could give him in three feet of film the emotion any other actor would take 10 to deliver, but in a single flash of Fonda's electric turquoise orbs, Leone (Kurosawa's first and sincerest flatterer-imitator) managed to say as much about John Ford, the devil, and the corruptions of the Way Out Western world as the genre ever would."
tt0064116,"It’s probably unwise to come to Leone looking for too much in the way of feminism. Instead, Once Upon a Time in the West offers quintessential examples of the things he was better known for, including another blustery Ennio Morricone score. Visually, he mostly vacillates between extreme close-ups of intense faces and vast widescreen compositions, a technique that is lurching but also luridly beautiful."
tt0064116,"Henry Fonda and Jason Robards relish each screen minute as the heavies, and Charles Bronson plays Clint Eastwood's 'man with no name' role. (Review of Original Release)"
tt0064116,"Good fun, especially if you like Leone's way of savoring the last morsel of every scene. (Review of Original Release)"
tt0064116,"The biggest, longest, most expensive Leone Western to date, and, in many ways, the most absurd... Granting the fact that it is quite bad, Once Upon the Time in the West is almost always interesting, wobbling, as it does, between being an epic lampoon and a serious hommage to the men who created the dreams of Leone's childhood. (Review of Original Release)"
tt0064116,"Alas, the big screen also magnifies the problems with Once Upon a Time in the West. Specifically, Leone’s insistence on style trumped the need for substance. The film is basically a B-Western stretched an agonizing 165 minutes."
tt0095765,"Remain open to fantasies but not be consumed by them. These are good lessons for a would-be director. They are good lessons for everybody. And no recent movie has taught them with more patient sweetness. [Feb. 5, 1990]"
tt0095765,Cinema Paradiso converts you to the credo that art can indeed be holy.
tt0095765,"You leave Cinema Paradiso with that feeling that's kind of like getting kicked in the stomach, but nice. It's one of those breathless, swept-away-by-a-movie experiences that you might have once a year, if you're lucky. [16 February 1990, Daily Notebook, p.E-1]"
tt0095765,Anyone who loves movies is likely to love Cinema Paradiso.
tt0095765,Just about everything you ever loved (or hated) about Italian films can be found.
tt0095765,"Lovely &#147;memory'' film. [2 March 1990, Life, p.4D]"
tt0095765,"A sweet, funny exercise in nostalgia, though it's also self-congratulatory and awfully calculating."
tt0095765,"Originally a two-part film running about three hours, this treacle has been reduced by almost a third, though it still seems to run on forever -- a bit like life but much less interesting."
tt0095765,"They don't make movies like they used to, and this Oscar-winning Italian-French co-production spends the better part of three hours proving it."
tt0095765,"A few moments of sly inspiration are not enough to carry an entire feature; along with the tears, it leaves behind an aftertaste of phoniness. [16 March 1990, Friday, p.H]"
tt0047396,"Rear Window lovingly invests in suspense all through the film, banking it in our memory, so that when the final payoff arrives, the whole film has been the thriller equivalent of foreplay."
tt0047396,"Flawless, essential viewing that would earn more than its five stars if only Empire would allow it."
tt0047396,The film leaps off the screen with a thrilling immediacy.
tt0047396,"As much as I admire all of these, especially ""Vertigo,"" I can't imagine that any one of them will top the feelings of exhilaration that are prompted by Rear Window, this most bittersweet of Hitchcockian suspense-romances. Make no mistake about it: Rear Window is as much of a romance as it is a brilliant exercise in suspense."
tt0047396,Hitchcock confines all of the action to this single setting and draws the nerves to the snapping point in developing the thriller phases of the plot. He is just as skilled in making use of lighter touches in either dialog or situation to relieve the tension when it nears the unbearable. Interest never wavers during the 112 minutes of footage.
tt0047396,"What's extraordinary, for a film that works on these different levels, is that it also manages to be a riveting thriller."
tt0047396,"Simply put, Rear Window is a great film, perhaps one of the finest ever committed to celluloid. All of the elements are perfect (or nearly so), including the acting, script, camerawork, music (by Franz Waxman), and, of course, direction. The brilliance of the movie is that, in addition to keeping viewers on the edges of their seats, it involves us in the lives of all of the characters, from Jefferies and Lisa to Miss Torso. There isn't a moment of waste in 113 minutes of screen time."
tt0047396,"A superb example of suspense filmmaking, especially when one considers the technical limitations of its single set."
tt0047396,"Mr. Stewart does a first-class job, playing the whole thing from a wheel chair and making points with his expressions and eyes. His handling of a lens-hound's paraphernalia in scanning the action across the way is very important to the color and fascination of the film."
tt0047396,"Quite aside from the violation of intimacy, which is shocking enough, Hitchcock has nowhere else come so close to pure misanthropy, nor given us so disturbing a definition of what it is to watch the 'silent film' of other people's lives, whether across a courtyard or up on a screen."
tt0078748,"This is the breakout role for Sigourney (n&#233;e Susan) Weaver, whose iconic presence still propels this ride beyond the scores of substandard imitations that followed. Why see it on the big screen? Because it's bloody brilliant."
tt0078748,Feels like a streamlined improvement on the original.
tt0078748,"Despite years of imitators, sequels (some great, some not so), and edited-for-television broadcasts, Alien has lost none of its power, and the big screen only intensifies its impact."
tt0078748,"Twenty-four years later -- digitally spruced up, with some scenes shaved and others padded with previously cut material -- Scott's film still shreds nerves."
tt0078748,"The most important features of this ""new"" version are the digital cleaning of the print and the re-mastering of the sound. There are a few added scenes, but they are mostly insignificant and have been previously seen (at least by fans of the movie) on the laserdisc or DVD releases."
tt0078748,"Alien, even with some scene tinkering that has left this ""director's cut"" one minute shorter than its original release, is still one of the creepiest, scariest, most shocking films ever."
tt0078748,"What's most unusual about the original 24 years later, though, is its elegant minimalism."
tt0078748,"An old nightmare, made shiny new."
tt0078748,"Mostly it's worth seeing Alien, which established Scott as an A-list director, in a theater because his brilliant and often expansive visuals have always worked better on a big screen than on video."
tt0078748,"An empty-headed horror movie (1979) with nothing to recommend it beyond the disco-inspired art direction and some handsome, if gimmicky, cinematography."
tt0021749,"There’s dignity and folly to The Tramp in City Lights, and everything in between."
tt0021749,"If only one of Charles Chaplin's films could be preserved, “City Lights” (1931) would come the closest to representing all the different notes of his genius. It contains the slapstick, the pathos, the pantomime, the effortless physical coordination, the melodrama, the bawdiness, the grace, and, of course, the Little Tramp--the character said, at one time, to be the most famous image on earth."
tt0021749,"Both funny and touching, this showcases Chaplin at his best."
tt0021749,"Of all Chaplin's films (with the possible exception of Modern Times), City Lights offers the fullest characterization of the Tramp. He's a loner who comes and goes almost like a dream figure or a drunken angel. Without family, friends, or a place to live, he stands outside of our reality, sometimes trying to fit in and sometimes not caring whether or not he does. Yet, like a child, he is a complete innocent with a pure heart and the best motives."
tt0021749,"We're exhausted because we laughed so much and so heartily at City Lights that we feel considerably weakened. Here's praying that we fast regain our strength so that we may journey to the George M. Cohan theatre to see Charlie again - and again - in this new heart-breaking masterpiece of comedy which he offers pantomimically to a worldful of movie-goers...City Lights is excruciatingly funny and terribly, terribly sad. It makes you chuckle hysterically. You have the greatest time imaginable, and yet, occasionally you find little hurty lumps in your throat."
tt0021749,It was a joyous evening. Mr. Chaplin's shadow has grown no less.
tt0021749,Its last few moments are among the most brilliant (and risky) endings in film history.
tt0021749,A beautiful example of Chaplin's ability to turn narrative fragments into emotional wholes. The two halves of the film are sentiment and slapstick. They are not blended but woven into a pattern as eccentric as it is sublime.
tt0021749,The movie exemplifies everything that was great and grating about the filmmaker’s artistry: his impeccable physical slapstick (see the boxing match) and his overreliance on embarrassing sentimentality; his intuitive understanding of the medium and frequent displays of the mammoth martyr complex that informed the comedian’s every move.
tt0021749,"It’s not Chaplin’s best picture, because the comedian has sacrificed speed to pathos, and plenty of it. This is principally the reason for the picture running some 1,500 or more feet beyond any previous film released by him. But the British comic is still the consummate pantomimist, unquestionably one of the greatest the stage or screen has ever known. Certain sequences in “City Lights” are hilarious."
tt0078788,"Remember the weird beauty of the massed helicopters lifting over the trees in the long shot, and the insane power of Wagner's music, played loudly during the attack, and you feel what Coppola was getting at: Those moments as common in life as art, when the whole huge grand mystery of the world, so terrible, so beautiful, seems to hang in the balance."
tt0078788,"As powerful as the movie remains and as much as I enjoyed this new cut, I have to say that the additional footage -- material that Coppola felt he had to excise 20 years ago to reach a commercial length -- has turned out to be something of a mixed blessing."
tt0078788,"Coppola and Murch have balanced their new edit with grace notes of sweetness, elegance and eroticism, and the payoff is grand, providing both a reprieve from the multiple blitzkriegs and a break in the monotony of the cruise up the Nung."
tt0078788,No other movie released this year is as much of a filmgoing necessity as Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now Redux.
tt0078788,"As befits both its tortuous hand-to-mouth genesis and the devastating conflict it reflects, this is a film of pure sensation, dazzling audiences with light and noise, laying bare the stark horror – and unimaginable thrill – of combat. And therein lies the true heart of darkness: if war is hell and heaven intertwined, where does morality fit in? And, in the final apocalyptic analysis, will any of it matter?"
tt0078788,Francis Ford Coppola went into the jungle to make his surreal ’Nam epic and almost lost his mind during one of the most protracted and accident-prone shoots in history. Thankfully the hallucinogenic results justified the means.
tt0078788,A film that needs to be seen on the big screen.
tt0078788,"Flawed but staggering cinema, the unforgettable Apocalypse Now setpieces are extraordinary."
tt0078788,"Coppola, with his bravura style of direction, has created a movie of harrowing intensity and staggering power. But if you accept the belief that art should enlighten and illuminate as well as arouse the emotions, I’m afraid that Apocalypse Now does not qualify as great art."
tt0078788,"The finished film remains a mess of tangled, turgid continuity and florid, mock-operatic style -- at best a collection of production numbers and set pieces waiting in rain for a story capable of accumulating suspense and meaning."
tt0209144,A hard and bright and tough film in all the best ways.
tt0209144,Enthralling or infuriating.
tt0209144,A puzzle movie in which the puzzle is actually worth the time and effort to solve.
tt0209144,Terrifically satisfying film.
tt0209144,"If nothing else, Memento is a savvy comment on the queasy uncertainties of the postmodern condition, in which history goes no further back than yesterday's news, and knowledge is supplanted by ""information"" from a tumult of spin-controlled, unreliable narrators."
tt0209144,Fiendishly tricky contraption.
tt0209144,"Bound to be talked about, debated and eviscerated far more than it's understood."
tt0209144,"The film takes this attempt to shatter narrative into little pieces about as far into incoherence as it can go; yet it is also full of odd, hypnotic menace."
tt0209144,Feels mostly like an audacious prank.
tt0209144,"Once you've seen it all once I bet you'll wish you were watching ""Groundhog Day"" -- again."
tt1853728,"A sharp shock of a film in an Awards season very full of movies so noble they become immobile. It's wildly unlikely to get much love from the Academy, and that's fine-bluntly, it's too good for them. With its bloody stew of history and hysteria, action taken from movies and atrocities taken from fact, Django isn't just a movie only America could make-it's also a movie only America needs to."
tt1853728,An immensely satisfying taste of antebellum empowerment packaged as spaghetti-Western homage... A bloody hilarious (and hilariously bloody) Christmas counter-programmer.
tt1853728,"Django Unchained also has the pure, almost meaningless excitement which I found sorely lacking in Tarantino's previous film, Inglourious Basterds, with its misfiring spaghetti-Nazi trope and boring plot. I can only say Django delivers, wholesale, that particular narcotic and delirious pleasure that Tarantino still knows how to confect in the cinema, something to do with the manipulation of surfaces. It's as unwholesome, deplorable and delicious as a forbidden cigarette."
tt1853728,"Only Tarantino could come up with such a wild cross-cultural mash, a smorgasbord of ingredients stemming from spaghetti Westerns, German legend, historical slavery, modern rap music, proto-Ku Klux Klan fashion, an assembly of '60s and '70s character actors and a leading couple meant to be the distant forebears of blaxploitation hero John Shaft and make it not only digestible but actually pretty delicious."
tt1853728,"Vibrating with the geekery of a filmmaker off the chain, the movie plays like no other this year. Tarantino, steeped in even the smallest Leonean gesture (what's with the weird terrain shifts?), knows how to satisfy fans of scuzzy Italian horse operas and badass superviolence in equal measure."
tt1853728,"At times more in line with ""Blazing Saddles"" than the grimly bawdy qualities that define many bonafide oaters, Django Unchained erupts with a conceptual brilliance from the outset that never fully meshes with its clumsy storyline. Nevertheless, it's a giddy ride."
tt1853728,"DiCaprio, having a blast, makes Candie the equivalent of Waltz's Nazi in ""Inglourious Basterds"": a racist villain who mesmerizes us by elevating his ideology into a puckishly thought-out vision of the world. Yet Django isn't nearly the film that Inglourious was."
tt1853728,"While the rush toward a conventional climax is confusing, and more than a little disappointing, there's an undeniable pleasure that emerges in seeing Tarantino juggle the dynamite of his ideas, even when they prematurely pop off in his face."
tt1853728,"The film also comes across like a rough cut that was never looked at as a coherent whole, and some segments that start off as promising become interminable while others feel entirely unnecessary. There's no pressure on or expectation for Tarantino to please anyone other than himself, and the film feels overstuffed with ideas that should have been pruned."
tt1853728,"It's not particularly funny or moving and it's terribly self-indulgent. Flamboyance and cartoonishness rule, there's hardly a moment of genuine emotion, and most overtures in that direction are superficial. As a picture ostensibly about love, revenge and the ugliness of slavery, Django Unchained has almost zero subtext and is a largely soulless bloodbath, in which the history of pain and retribution is coupled carelessly with a cool soundtrack and some verbose dialogue. Though it might just entertain the sh.t out of the less discerning."
tt0082971,Plays like an anthology of the best parts from all the Saturday matinee serials ever made.
tt0082971,Spielberg can never top this. Period.
tt0082971,"One of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made."
tt0082971,Steven Spielberg turns the pure adventure of Saturday afternoon serials into a solidly entertaining spectacle.
tt0082971,"Has all the right ingredients: a smart script, a likable hero, a dash of romance, more than a touch of comedy, and a lot of fast-paced action."
tt0082971,Ford's performance is an underrated but remarkable achievement; he succeeds in fully embodying a comic-book style hero without ever descending into camp.
tt0082971,Spielberg has deftly veiled proceedings in a sense of mystical wonder that makes it all the more easy for viewers to suspend disbelief and settle back for the fun.
tt0082971,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be. What is it? An adventure film that plays like an old-time 12-part serial that you see all at once, instead of Saturday-to-Saturday. It's a modern ""Thief of Baghdad."" It's the kind of movie that first got you excited about movies when you were a kid."
tt0082971,Finds the right balance between reverence and wit.
tt0082971,"Travels fast and straight down a linear plot, and the ceaseless rush quickly becomes monotonous."
tt0910970,A film that's both breathtakingly majestic and heartbreakingly intimate.
tt0910970,"The visual design of Wall-E is arguably Pixar's best. Stanton, who wrote the script with Jim Reardon from a story he concocted with Peter Docter, creates two fantastically imaginative, breathtakingly lit worlds."
tt0910970,"While I may argue with the little guy's taste in musicals, it's remarkable to see any film, in any genre, blend honest sentiment with genuine wit and a visual landscape unlike any other."
tt0910970,"A charming, hilarious robot love story aimed at the entire family."
tt0910970,"At once futuristic, funny and fantastical."
tt0910970,"This is Pixar's finest and most emotionally powerful film yet, and it draws on a wealth of cinematic resources that run the gamut from Chaplin's best to Buster Keaton, Jacques Tati, and even Martin and Lewis."
tt0910970,"Succeeds at being three things at once: an enthralling animated film, a visual wonderment and a decent science-fiction story."
tt0910970,A potent environmental message wrapped up in an irresistibly cute romance between robots.
tt0910970,"Walks a fine line between the rarefied and the immediately accessible as it explores new territory for animation, yet remains sufficiently crowd-pleasing."
tt0910970,"The movie's first half is largely free of dialogue, playing like silent comedy, while the second act offers a breathtaking tour of the cosmos."
tt0405094,"If there is any justice, this year's Academy Award for best foreign-language film will go to The Lives of Others, a movie about a world in which there is no justice."
tt0405094,"It convincingly demonstrates that when done right, moral and political quandaries can be the most intensely dramatic dilemmas of all."
tt0405094,"It's hard to believe this is von Donnersmarck's first feature. His storytelling gifts have the novelistic richness of a seasoned master. The accelerating plot twists are more than just clever surprises; they reverberate with deep and painful ironies, creating both suspense and an emotional impact all the more powerful because it creeps up so quietly."
tt0405094,"Ulrich Mühe gives a marvelously self-contained performance. There isn't an ounce of fat on his body, or in his acting: He has pared himself down to a pair of eyes that prowl the faces of his character's countrymen for signs of arrogance--i.e., of independent thinking."
tt0405094,Von Donnersmarck has crafted the best kind of movie: one you can't get out of your head.
tt0405094,"With solid performances and a terrific screenplay, this movie offers solid, no-frills drama that feels organic and believable, not contrived."
tt0405094,Starts out dark and challenging then comes to a startlingly satisfying and warmly human conclusion that lingers long after the curtain has come down.
tt0405094,Superbly cast drama… that looks to be a solid upscale attraction wherever the special chemistry of good writing and performances is appreciated.
tt0405094,A compelling thriller but an unsatisfying character drama.
tt0405094,"The Lives of Others wants us to see that the Stasi -- at least some of them -- were, like their Gestapo brethren, “just following orders."" You can call that naive optimism on Donnersmarck's part, or historical revisionism of the sort duly lambasted by the current film version of Alan Bennett's ""The History Boys."" I, for one, tremble at the thought of what this young director does for an encore."
tt0043014,"No other motion picture about Hollywood comes near Billy Wilder's searing, uncompromising and utterly fascinating portrait of the film community."
tt0043014,The finest movie ever made about the narcissistic hellhole that is Hollywood.
tt0043014,"Sunset Boulevard remains the best drama ever made about the movies because it sees through the illusions, even if Norma doesn't."
tt0043014,"Subtle, savage and insightful but with such a big heart it is as moving as it is informative about the value of making art that moves."
tt0043014,This is an unmissable commentary on Hollywood's rejection of its silent past: a kind of Sobbin' in the Rain.
tt0043014,Sunset Blvd. represents the center stone in Billy Wilder's glittering cinematic tiara.
tt0043014,"Performances by the entire cast, and particularly William Holden and Gloria Swanson, are exceptionally fine."
tt0043014,"Billy Wilder’s cynical edge is finely honed in this darkly amusing satire, which won three Academy Awards. It’s a film that is perennially ready for its close-up."
tt0043014,"What's not recognized enough is the indelible, self-sickened performance of William Holden as Desmond's boy-toy/hired hack."
tt0043014,A tour de force for Swanson and one of Wilder’s better efforts.
tt0050825,"This is the director’s most vivid, most emotional and humane film, and perhaps his best."
tt0050825,"Banned in France for 18 years, this masterpiece still packs a wallop, though nothing in it is as simple as it may first appear; audiences are still arguing about the final sequence, which has been characterized as everything from a sentimental cop-out to the ultimate cynical twist."
tt0050825,"Paths of Glory was the film by which Stanley Kubrick entered the ranks of great directors, never to leave them."
tt0050825,"It is arguably the best film about the first world war, and still has a reasonable claim to being Stanley Kubrick's best film."
tt0050825,One of the greatest war films ever made.
tt0050825,Paths of Glory undoubtedly succeeds in both foreshadowing the bravura auteurism that was to come as well as lampooning the abhorrent bureaucracy that destroyed the lives of so many brave young men in Europe's trenches.
tt0050825,"The searing Paths Of Glory continues to impress with its striking blend of formal brilliance, economical storytelling and emotional directness."
tt0050825,"The sardonic rhetoric may be laid on a little heavily at times, but the movie is blunt and scornfully brilliant."
tt0050825,"Mr. Kubrick has made it look terrific. The execution scene is one of the most craftily directed and emotionally lacerating that we have ever seen. But there are two troubling flaws in this picture, one in the realm of technique and the other in the realm of significance, which determine its larger, lasting worth."
tt0050825,"While the subject is well handled and enacted in a series of outstanding characterizations, it seems dated and makes for grim screen fare."
tt0081505,"But there is no way, within the film, to be sure with any confidence exactly what happens, or precisely how, or really why. Kubrick delivers this uncertainty in a film where the actors themselves vibrate with unease."
tt0081505,"Ostensibly a haunted house story, it manages to traverse a complex world of incipient madness, spectral murder and supernatural visions ...and also makes you jump."
tt0081505,"Meticulously detailed and never less than fascinating, The Shining may be the first movie that ever made its audience jump with a title that simply says ""Tuesday."""
tt0081505,"For a supposed mainstream movie, Kubrick’s The Shining isn’t very audience friendly. Half the time you have to guess what the hell is going on, and if you're not familiar with Kubrick's narrative style you’ll be completely lost."
tt0081505,"When you sit down to The Shining, you sit down with normal expectations of being diverted, perhaps even being gripped, but not being undermined. But the film undermines you in powerful, inchoate ways. It's a horror story even for people who don't like horror stories - maybe especially for them. [14 Jun 1980, p.1]"
tt0081505,"Stephen King reportedly loathed the liberties Kubrick and co-writer Diane Johnson took with his story, but King's ur-villain, the emasculated husband from hell, has never been more clearly presented on-screen."
tt0081505,"It is a daring thing the director has done, this bleaching out of all the cheap thrills, this dashing of all the hopes one brings to what is, after all, advertised as ""a masterpiece of modern horror."" Certainly he has asked much of Nicholson, who must sustain attention in a hugely unsympathetic role, and who responds with a brilliantly crazed performance."
tt0081505,"The crazier Nicholson gets, the more idiotic he looks. Shelley Duvall transforms the warm sympathetic wife of the book into a simpering, semi-retarded hysteric."
tt0081505,"Kubrick is after a cool, sunlit vision of hell, born in the bosom of the nuclear family, but his imagery--with its compulsive symmetry and brightness--is too banal to sustain interest, while the incredibly slack narrative line forestalls suspense."
tt0081505,"Kubrick certainly doesn't fail small. One could fast forget The Shining as an overreaching, multi-levelled botch were it not for Jack Nicholson. Nicholson, one of the few actors capable of getting the audience to love him no matter what he does, is an ideal vehicle for Kubrick. [14 Jun 1980, p.E1]"
tt4154756,"Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain to set the stakes higher than ever, Avengers: Infinity War successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics."
tt4154756,"Somehow in its pure uproariousness, it works. It’s just a supremely watchable film, utterly confident in its self-created malleable mythology. And confident also in the note of apocalyptic darkness."
tt4154756,"The script is surprisingly smart, pulling together all the subplots and cutting among all the locations. Chris Pratt’s Star Lord has some clever lines. Thanos is a far more complex villain than we usually get. And the movie ends on a stark and shocking note."
tt4154756,"Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes ... at least not yet."
tt4154756,"As a virtuoso juggling act, Infinity War has no real parallel in popular culture; as a movie, it’s an impressive montage of greatest hits until the gut punch of a finale."
tt4154756,What saves Infinity War from being just another bloated supergroup tour – and what will end up being the thing that blows fans’ minds to dust – is the film’s final stretch.
tt4154756,"Directors Joe and Anthony Russo move their many playing pieces around with as much grace as possible, and they offer up jolts of pleasure throughout."
tt4154756,"Avengers: Infinity War cares a bit too much about being ""Part 1"" and holding enough development for ""Part 2,"" but MCU fans should see their 10-year buildup expectations met - not exceeded, but met."
tt4154756,"I appreciate the sheer logistical achievement of Infinity War (and the chutzpah of its ending). I laughed a bunch of times, and some of the scenes are definitely exciting. But I would be lying if I pretended this movie ever grabbed me the way the best MCU movies did."
tt4154756,Infinity War is all manic monotony. It's passably numbing in the moment. And despite the hard-luck finish—something an obligatory post-credits sequence goes a long way toward neutering—it's instantly forgettable.
tt0051201,"Dietrich steals it. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is a witty, terse adaptation of the Agatha Christie hit play brought to the screen with ingenuity and vitality by Billy Wilder."
tt0051201,"For a courtroom melodrama pegged to a single plot device--a device that, of course, everybody promises not to reveal--the Arthur Hornblow Jr. film production of the Agatha Christie play ""Witness for the Prosecution"" comes off extraordinarily well. This results mainly from Billy Wilder's splendid staging of some splintering courtroom scenes and a first-rate theatrical performance by Charles Laughton in the defense-attorney role."
tt0051201,"The courtroom scenes are terrific, with brittle dialogue expertly delivered. And Wilder milks Christie's surprise denouement for all it's worth. [21 Nov 1986, p.92]"
tt0051201,"Billy Wilder’s trademark sardonicism lends welcome bite and wit to this twisting, turning murder mystery from Agatha Christie."
tt0051201,"While not amongst the greater, more celebrated titles in Billy Wilder’s acclaimed filmography, his big screen adaptation of Agatha Christie’s Witness for the Prosecution boasts a fine, scenery-chewing performance by Charles Laughton, here playing a cantankerous barrister defending a murder suspect."
tt0051201,Marlene Dietrich tries not to give anything away as usual while Agatha Christie's whodunit plot whirs tidily about her expressionless beauty.
tt0051201,The combination of Christie and Wilder ensures the story is impeccably told and the dialogue is unsurpassable from start to finish.
tt0051201,"The artificial plotting is all Christie’s, but the film eventually becomes Wilder’s—thanks to a trick ending that dovetails nicely with a characteristic revelation of compassion behind cruelty. His theatrical mise-en-scene—his proscenium framing—serves the material well, as does Charles Laughton’s bombastic portrayal of the defense attorney."
tt0051201,"A courtroom meller played engagingly and building evenly to a surprising and arousing, albeit tricked-up, climax, Witness for the Prosecution has been transferred to the screen (from the Agatha Christie click play) with competence."
tt0051201,"Tyrone Power is surprisingly good as the man accused of murdering his mistress, but the swift twists and turns of Ms Christie's plot soon drain Dietrich and Laughton's roles of any dramatic credibility."
tt0090605,"Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/action package."
tt0090605,"For this movie stands to be something its predecessor was not, a megahit. And it deserves to be, for it is a remarkable accomplishment: a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore."
tt0090605,Truly great cinema- manages to dodge that 'dodgy sequel' curse with ease.
tt0090605,"There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles."
tt0090605,I'm giving the movie a high rating for its skill and professionalism and because it does the job it says it will do. I am also advising you not to eat before you go to see it.
tt0090605,Director James Cameron dumps the decorative effects of Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien in favor of some daring narrative strategies and a tight thematic focus.
tt0090605,James Cameron's vault into the big time after scoring with the exploitation actioner The Terminator makes up for lack of surprise with sheer volume of thrills and chills - emphasis is decidedly on the plural aspect of the title.
tt0090605,"The startling thing about ""Aliens"" is how obsessed it is with women as child bearers. It's the theme that allows the movie to have all the trappings of a typical science fiction/action movie while creating a primal emotive connection for the audience."
tt0090605,"Under the direction of James (''The Terminator'') Cameron, [the special effects team has] put together a flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics."
tt0090605,"Cameron isn't as concerned with scares or atmosphere, the staples of traditional horror films, as he is with setting up difficult situations for his characters to get out of, leaving audiences deliciously on edge."
tt4633694,"It’s incredibly thrilling to watch, impressively emotional throughout, and easily the best Spider-Man movie since “Spider-Man 2.”"
tt4633694,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse delivers a dynamic visual experience unlike any other.
tt4633694,"It’s a slightly insane, hilariously daring and often touching mashup of everything that makes super-flicks so darn popular with the introduction of a Spider-Man who's ready-made for today’s generation of kids."
tt4633694,"Tragic news for anyone who’s sick of superhero movies: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse completely reinvigorates the genre, reaffirms why it’s resonating with a diverse modern audience that’s desperate to fight the power, and reiterates to us how these hyper-popular spandex myths are able to reinvent themselves on the fly whenever things get stale."
tt4633694,"The filmmaking itself is often witty, finding gags in whip-crack editing and shifts in perspective."
tt4633694,"Into the Spider-Verse really is the ultimate Spider-Man film in a lot of ways, the one that crystallizes the character’s moral philosophy, his life lessons, his arachnid athleticism, and his quirky sense of humor into one hugely appealing package. It’s pure dorky fun."
tt4633694,"With its risky visual storytelling and tender script, Into the Spider-Verse earns the greatest honor that one can bestow on a Spider-Man movie: It somehow makes you want to see more Spider-Man movies. Including at least a few more for Miles Morales alone."
tt4633694,"A confident blend of comic-book élan and stirring sentiment, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse finds fresh ways to tell the familiar story of everyone’s favourite web-slinger."
tt4633694,"The freshest and most stimulating aspect of the film is the visual style, which unites the expected Marvel mix of “universes” (it used to be assumed there was only one universe in creation) with animation that looks both computer-driven and hand-drawn, boasts futuristic as well as funky urban elements, moves the “camera” a lot and brings together a melting pot of mostly amusing new characters."
tt4633694,"For a film that invites so much self-aware chortling over franchise in-jokery, you feel Spider-Verse has missed something essential from its own screen history."
tt0169547,"Spacey, an actor who embodies intelligence in his eyes and voice, is the right choice for Lester Burnham."
tt0169547,A dark comical masterpiece that single-handedly announces the collapse of the American family infrastructure as it exists on the brink of Y2K.
tt0169547,"It gracefully defies the usual categories, gets under your skin in ways you cannot anticipate, then works its way straight toward the heart. It's far and away the bravest and best movie of the year."
tt0169547,"Hilarious, slightly sick, and super-edgy ...the acting of its two principals, Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey, is so sublime that it's worth seeing on that grounds alone."
tt0169547,"Hilarious, painful and brutally frank."
tt0169547,"Though excellent in many ways, American Beauty is, finally, an uneasy mix of assured technique and simplistic satire."
tt0169547,Kevin Spacey (gives) a truly great performance.
tt0169547,Surprises you with a kind of hardheaded romanticism.
tt0169547,A ruthless dissection of suburban malaise.
tt0169547,A satire whose dead aim stops wounding - and starts making - stereotypes of white middle-classness.
tt0057012,A masterpiece... The genius of Dr. Strangelove is that it's possible to laugh -- and laugh hard -- while still recognizing the intelligence and insight behind the humor.
tt0057012,The film is a model of barely controlled hysteria in which the absurdity of hypermasculine Cold War posturing becomes devastatingly funny--and at the same time nightmarishly frightening in its accuracy.
tt0057012,"More lethal than a nuclear waste dump, Kubrick's komedy at least kills us with laughter... It's one of the greatest - and undoubtably the most hilarious - antiwar statements ever put to film."
tt0057012,"Seen after 30 years, Dr. Strangelove seems remarkably fresh and undated - a clear-eyed, irreverant, dangerous satire. And its willingness to follow the situation to its logical conclusion - nuclear annihilation - has a purity that today's lily-livered happy-ending technicians would probably find a way around."
tt0057012,Kubrick's comic gem sparkles with enduring relevance.
tt0057012,"The hard-charging originality of the screenplay&#151;the equivalent of turning ""The Hot Zone"" into a Farrelly comedy&#151;suggests a deficient legacy of credit to Terry Southern's corner."
tt0057012,"Is Dr. Strangelove Kubrick's best movie? Along with ''Paths of Glory,"" absolutely."
tt0057012,"George C. Scott as the fiery Pentagon general who seizes on the crisis as a means to argue for total annihilation of Russia offers a top performance, one of the best in the film. Odd as it may seem in this backdrop, he displays a fine comedy touch."
tt0057012,"Yet some of the laughs come too easy and linger too long; for the film's message to have maximum impact, the laughter has to stick in your throat."
tt0057012,"The ultimate touch of ghoulish humor is when we see the bomb actually going off, dropped on some point in Russia, and a jazzy sound track comes in with a cheerful melodic rendition of ""We'll Meet Again Some Sunny Day."" Somehow, to me, it isn't funny. It is malefic and sick."
tt1345836,"Makes everything in the rival Marvel universe look thoroughly silly and childish. Entirely enveloping and at times unnerving in a relevant way one would never have imagined, as a cohesive whole this ranks as the best of Nolan's trio, even if it lacks -- how could it not? -- an element as unique as Heath Ledger's immortal turn in The Dark Knight. It's a blockbuster by any standard."
tt1345836,"A smart, stirring spectacle that faces down impossible expectations to pull off a hugely satisfying end to business."
tt1345836,"With spectacle in abundance and sexiness in (supporting) parts, this is superhero filmmaking on an unprecedented scale. Rises may lack the surprise of Begins or the anarchy of Knight, but it makes up for that in pure emotion."
tt1345836,"""The Avengers"" is kid stuff compared with this meditation on mortal loss and heroic frailty. For once a melodrama with pulp origins convinces viewers that it can be the modern equivalent to Greek myths or a Jonathan Swift satire. TDKR is that big, that bitter - a film of grand ambitions and epic achievement. The most eagerly anticipated movie of summer 2012 was worth waiting for."
tt1345836,"While The Dark Knight Rises raises the dramatic stakes considerably, at least in terms of its potential body count, it doesn't have its predecessor's breathless sense of menace or its demonic showmanship, and with the exception of one audacious sleight-of-hand twist, the story can at times seem more complicated than intricate."
tt1345836,The sheer scope of Nolan's vision – with emotion and spectacle thundering across the screen – is staggering. The Dark Knight Rises is the King Daddy of summer movie epics.
tt1345836,"The Dark Knight Rises may be a hammy, portentous affair but Nolan directs it with aplomb. He takes these cod-heroic, costumed elements and whisks them into a tale of heavy-metal fury, full of pain and toil, surging uphill, across the flyovers, in search of a climax."
tt1345836,"A spectacular noir epic that's equal parts murky, bloated, flashy and triumphantly cinematic. Four years after Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" sequel ""The Dark Knight"" rattled audiences with a similar audiovisual overload, the new movie falls into the same rhythm and remains viscerally satisfying even when the story falters."
tt1345836,"A fine film in a strong summer, but it lacks the spark that made its immediate predecessor a masterpiece."
tt1345836,"Grand scale or no, this feels like a blockbuster on autopilot more often than not, curiously detached and self-importantly somber even by the director's standards - and without the cerebral heft of his best work."
tt0361748,"With Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino has made his best movie since ""Pulp Fiction."" He has also made what could arguably be considered the most audacious World War II movie of all-time."
tt0361748,"Energetic, inventive, swaggering fun, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a consummate Hollywood entertainment--rich in fantasy and blithely amoral."
tt0361748,"With its exploded notions of heroism, torture-rack dramatics and kamikaze gusto, it's a fiendishly entertaining flick."
tt0361748,"A violent fairy tale, an increasingly entertaining fantasia in which the history of World War II is wildly reimagined so that the cinema can play the decisive role in destroying the Third Reich."
tt0361748,"With a confidence typical of its director, the last line of Inglourious Basterds is, ""This might just be my masterpiece."" While that may not be true, this is an often dazzling movie that sees QT back on exhilarating form."
tt0361748,"Even more than his other genre mash-ups, this is a switchback journey through Tarantino’s twisted inner landscape, where cinema and history, misogyny and feminism, sadism and romanticism collide and split and re-bond in bizarre new hybrids. The movie is an ungainly pastiche, yet on some wacked-out Jungian level it’s all of a piece."
tt0361748,"In Tarantino's besotted historical reverie, real-life villains Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels are played as grotesque jokes. The Basterds are played as exaggeratedly tough Jews. The women are femmes fatales.?"
tt0361748,"The biggest, weirdest, ugliest cartoon in Inglourious Basterds is Aldo Raine, the Nazi-killing American Lieutenant played by Brad Pitt."
tt0361748,"The film is by no means terrible -- its two hours and 32 minutes running time races by -- but those things we think of as being Tarantino-esque, the long stretches of wickedly funny dialogue, the humor in the violence and outsized characters strutting across the screen, are largely missing."
tt0361748,"Inglourious Basterds is not boring, but it’s ridiculous and appallingly insensitive."
tt0364569,"It's a movie of such jaw-dropping violence, wild improbability and dazzling style it overpowers all resistance."
tt0364569,"Whatever its oversteps and excesses (I do think Park ran a little amok with the computer gimcrackery), Oldboy has the bulldozing nerve and full-blooded passion of a classic."
tt0364569,"As always with Park Chanwook, you just hold on and let him rip."
tt0364569,"Once the picture gets into Hollywood's bloodstream, it could well prove to be as influential as John Woo's 1989 crime thriller, ""The Killer."""
tt0364569,"A wild, intensely cinematic ride into two men's burning desire to get even."
tt0364569,"The result is a powerfully visceral experience that justifies itself almost entirely on surface chops, with striking color composition and a complex sound design that elevates the story to an operatic scale."
tt0364569,"Regardless of how you look at Oldboy, it's unlike anything you are likely to have seen before."
tt0364569,Oldboy has the fatal air of wanting so desperately to be a cult movie that it forgets to present itself as a coherent one.
tt0364569,"Oldboy caused a love-it-or-hate-it stir at Cannes last year, and how could it not: It's an onslaught made to cause a sensation. Consider me simultaneously jolted and depressed."
tt0364569,"Put simply, in my humble opinion, Oldboy sucks."
tt0086879,Remains the most popularly successful film ever to render the inner life of an artist.
tt0086879,"It still soars, but now it seems richer, more expansive. Amadeus reminds us that movies can be lyrical as well as vulgar, ambitious as well as playful, brilliant as well as down and dirty -- just like Amadeus himself."
tt0086879,One of the finest qualities of Amadeus is that it reminds us of those rare occasions when an Oscar sweep is actually merited.
tt0086879,Perfect pitch.
tt0086879,Amadeus is about as close to perfection as movies get.
tt0086879,"The superbly edited original version of Amadeus used overlapping sound cues for a lively flow between scenes, and the new version breaks up some of that flow with lengthy, talky interludes. Still, Ondr&#237;cek's breathtaking images and Forman's essential craft are best appreciated on the big screen, and another theatrical run for Amadeus is a welcome gift, no matter how much this edition unnecessarily gilds what's already a near-perfect lily"
tt0086879,"Except for the Mozart music and Tharp movements around the edges, Amadeus plays like a monument to mediocrity. The movie belongs to Salieri."
tt0086879,The big-screen reissue offers a rare chance to admire the marvelous production details.
tt0086879,"Amadeus needs an additional 20 minutes running time like ""The Magic Flute"" needs a drum solo. Though the production is gussied up with more frills and decoration than a Viennese dessert trolley, Forman is generally workmanlike in his visual style and very uneven with his handling of actors."
tt0086879,"It binds up introductory lessons in music appreciation, Freudian psychology, and fanciful history with a pulp thriller plot."
tt2380307,"At every imaginative juncture, the filmmakers (the screenplay is credited to Pixar veteran Molina and Matthew Aldrich) create a richly woven tapestry of comprehensively researched storytelling, fully dimensional characters, clever touches both tender and amusingly macabre, and vivid, beautifully textured visuals."
tt2380307,"Thankfully, Coco, Pixar’s latest original work and one of their very best, truly does transport you. The results are magical and feel somewhat rebellious given the current political climate, which makes the film feel even more special."
tt2380307,"Coco is the best-looking Pixar movie since the tonally uneven “The Good Dinosaur.” The colorful afterlife is the centerpiece, but excellence is found in unexpected places."
tt2380307,"If an animated movie is going to offer children a way to process death, it’s hard to envision a more spirited, touching and breezily entertaining example than Coco."
tt2380307,"This is a masterpiece of woven ancestral roots and the importance of “familia,” confident in song and poetic in vision."
tt2380307,"The whole enterprise is amusing, warm and embracing, so much so that English words fall short of perfectly summing up this utterly charming film. Only a Spanish word will do. “Encantada.”"
tt2380307,"In any case, it works: Coco’s creators clearly had the perfect ending in mind before they’d nailed down all the other details, and though the movie drags in places, and features a few too many childish gags...the story’s sincere emotional resolution earns the sobs it’s sure to inspire."
tt2380307,"One of the films best visual treats are its alebrijes, the colorful fantastical creatures from Mexican folk art, rendered here as electrically colored lizards and gryphons that seem to pop off the screen even without the aid of 3-D."
tt2380307,"Fresh and stale in equal measure, Coco represents the best of what Pixar can be, and the worst of what they’ve become."
tt2380307,"In its zeal to pay proper respect to Mexican traditions and to avoid any hint of appropriation, Coco fails to give as much attention to its perfunctory characters or mediocre plotting, resulting in a family film which is reverent rather than inspired."
tt0114709,Once again Disney has come up with a winning animated feature that has something for everyone on the age spectrum.
tt0114709,"What the bright minds of Walt Disney have produced here is a must-see movie. Must-see, must-talk-about, must-plan-to-see-again."
tt0114709,"There's a giddy, absurd charm to the story, in which the strange setting only enhances the comfortable familiarity of the narrative and characters."
tt0114709,The film will intoxicate children and charm the parents in their company.
tt0114709,A visionary roller-coaster ride of a movie.
tt0114709,"The first animated feature produced entirely on computer is a magically witty and humane entertainment, a hellzapoppin fairy tale about a roomful of suburban toys who come to life when humans aren't around."
tt0114709,"A gem of fast action, sophisticated wit and inspired comedy."
tt0114709,"The very good news is that, in addition to stylistic innovation, the film sports a provocative and appealing story that's every bit the equal of this technical achievement."
tt0114709,"Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios join forces on an entertaining computer-generated, hyperrealist animation feature that's also in effect a toy catalog."
tt0114709,"The first all computer-animated feature, which brings a bedroom of playthings to bouncy life, is yummy eye candy spiked with 3-D-style tactile treats."
tt0112573,"Offeris an exhilarating, and occasionally touching, experience that has viewers leaving the theater caught up in an afterglow of wonder. These days, heros like William Wallace are as rare as motion picture displays of this high, uncompromising quality."
tt0112573,One of the most spectacular entertainments in years.
tt0112573,Looks like a true epic...even if it is both bloody and bloody long.
tt0112573,"Despite a formidable effort and occasional grace, there's something cowardly about Braveheart -- it's an aspiring giant with a diminutive soul."
tt0112573,"Gibson's raw energy and storytelling power in Braveheart are undeniable. If the film doesn't meet his ambitions, it's because he set the bar so high."
tt0112573,"The graphic battles may grow repetitious toward the end, the final scenes are almost sadistically drawn out, and the script often lacks humor. But this movie moves."
tt0112573,"Never tries to confuse our loyalties or question the strategies of our hero or bring home the all-embracing soul-destroying horrors of war for all sides. Braveheart may be rip-roaring, but it isn't all that brave."
tt0112573,"A massive, sweaty, frequently silly epic that nevertheless delivers enough brute pleasure to pass a rainy afternoon."
tt0112573,"Braveheart is too much, too late."
tt0112573,A rambling disappointment.
tt7286456,"Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come."
tt7286456,"More character study than comic book movie, and anchored by an Oscar-worthy Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is a bravura blockbuster that proves you don’t need superpowered scraps to dazzle."
tt7286456,Joaquin Phoenix is devastating as the villain-in-the-making in this incendiary tale of psychological escape and psychopathy.
tt7286456,"Bold, devastating and utterly beautiful, Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself."
tt7286456,A part of me found Todd Phillips’s radical rethinking of the Batman villain Joker thrillingly uncompromising and hair-raisingly timely. Another thinks it should be locked in a strongbox then dropped in the ocean and never released.
tt7286456,"This is Phoenix's film, and he inhabits it with an insanity by turns pitiful and fearsome in an out-there performance that's no laughing matter. Not to discredit the imaginative vision of the writer-director, his co-scripter and invaluable tech and design teams, but Phoenix is the prime force that makes Joker such a distinctively edgy entry in the Hollywood comics industrial complex."
tt7286456,"For all its merits, however, Joker relies on perhaps a touch too much exposition as it attempts to shape a digestible origin story."
tt7286456,"It’s good enough to be dangerous, and bad enough to demand better. It’s going to turn the world upside down and make us all hysterical in the process. For better or worse, it’s exactly the movie the Joker would want."
tt7286456,"The broadness of Phoenix’s work allows the rest of the ensemble — particularly Conroy, Zazie Beetz as a single-mom neighbor, and MVP character actors like Bill Camp, Shea Whigham and Brian Tyree Henry — to dial it down and give effectively human-size performances."
tt7286456,"As social commentary, Joker is pernicious garbage. But besides the wacky pleasures of Phoenix’s performance, it also displays some major movie studio core competencies, in a not dissimilar way to what “A Star Is Born” presented last year."
tt0082096,Wolfgang Petersen's direction is an exercise in pure craftsmanship. [Director's Cut]
tt0082096,The most convincing war movie ever made.
tt0082096,"At once a devastating condemnation of war and an exciting action film...The additional running time only adds to Petersen's masterfully bleak, claustrophobic atmosphere. Das Boot is by no means a pleasant experience, but it's an intelligent and emotionally gripping one that you won't forget. [Director's Cut]"
tt0082096,"Takes all of the drama and suspense inherent in a submarine-based story and delivers it in a near-perfect package, establishing Das Boot as not just a terrific adrenaline rush, but one of the best movies ever made. [Director's Cut]"
tt0082096,Absolutely devastating filmmaking that makes you simultaneously feel the glory and the absolute futility of war. [Director's Cut]
tt0082096,"One of the most suspenseful films of all time, its wartime action setting makes it easy to forget it's also one of the most spiritually righteous. [Director's Cut]"
tt0082096,"Sweaty and claustrophobic, exciting and horrifying at the same time, it never lets us forget we're riding aboard a giant, primitive tin can, a hunk of industrial machinery that mingles the illusion of omnipotence with the reality of a floating prison cell. [Director's Cut]"
tt0082096,"As torpedoes shoot through the seas and depth charges pass by, carrying their whining cargo of destruction, Das Boot brings the presence of death to within a whisper of the eardrum."
tt0082096,"A visually spectacular film, distinguished by strong performances and brilliant Steadicam photography that snakes through the U-boat as its patrols the North Atlantic during World War II. [Director's Cut]"
tt0082096,"The film has no qualities beyond its formal polish--and its careful avoidance (or rather, displacement) of the moral and political issues involved can seem too crafty, too convenient."
tt4154796,"I have to admit, in all its surreal grandiosity, in all its delirious absurdity, there is a huge sugar rush of excitement to this mighty finale, finally interchanging with euphoric emotion and allowing us to say poignant farewells."
tt4154796,"Avengers: Endgame is easily the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most ambitious, emotional, and affecting film to date, somehow managing to tie up more than a decade of storytelling in a confident (and mostly coherent) climax - a hurdle that many other blockbuster franchises have stumbled over in their final runs."
tt4154796,What's best about Markus and McFeely's script is that they understand the characters.
tt4154796,"If the Marvel superhero movies on the whole are your favorite band’s individual albums, Avengers: Endgame is the triple-disc greatest-hits package with the really awesome cover and a slew of familiar, comforting gems inside."
tt4154796,"The movie largely delivers, splashing its ambitious three-hour narrative across a sprawling canvas of characters, eras, and not-quite-insurmountable challenges."
tt4154796,"No matter what comes next from Marvel Studios, this Avengers is a gargantuan love letter to the equally enormous mythology that Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and the rest of their collaborators built — and to the generations of readers and moviegoers who truly believe in it."
tt4154796,"Avengers: Endgame has almost nothing on its mind but crossing the Ts and dotting the Is of a far-flung superhero saga, but to anyone with even a minor emotional stake in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it has all the fleeting satisfaction of a shot of whipped cream delivered directly from the spray can."
tt4154796,"It’s the time travel conceit that keeps “Endgame” hopping, and the trial-and-error sequences recall some of the best parts of the first “Iron Man” 11 years back."
tt4154796,"While constantly eventful and a feast for the eyes, it's also notably more somber than its predecessors. But just when it might seem about to become too grim, Robert Downey Jr. rides to the rescue with an inspired serio-comic performance that reminds you how good he can be."
tt4154796,"Even if I could muster the strength to defy studio marching orders on plot details, there is no point. There is little in Endgame that is worth spoiling, given how its core is spoiled rotten to begin with."
tt0119698,One of the most visually inventive films I have ever seen.
tt0119698,"Its breadth, profundity, and stunningly rendered vision make idealism seem renewed and breathtaking again."
tt0119698,"A big movie for the ages, full to the brim with sympathy, imagination and sheer visual delight."
tt0119698,"Rarely does any film, animated or otherwise, immerse you in such a vivid landscape and engage your senses so strongly."
tt0119698,"Like a lot of anime, it's overlong and gets way too metaphysical at the end, but ultimately, this is a Princess worth worshipping."
tt0119698,"Exceedingly imaginative, beautifully realized animated epic adventure."
tt0119698,The film's storytelling and heartfelt pantheism are both impressive.
tt0119698,A must-see for animation fans.
tt0119698,It's Miyazaki's use of sound--and silence--that takes your breath away
tt0119698,As spectacular as it is dense and as dense as it is colorful and as colorful as it is meaningless and as meaningless as it is long.
tt0119217,"With its sweet soul and sharp mind, it's one of the most heartening films of the year."
tt0119217,"Gus Van Sant, working from the tangy, well-written script, gets so much humor, grit and emotional truth out of this tale that the familiar formulas behind it simply fall away."
tt0119217,This beautifully realized tale is always engaging and often quite touching.
tt0119217,Fairly bursts with the exuberance and youthful energy that must have attended its creation.
tt0119217,"An ordinary story told well. Taken as a whole, there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path, leaves the audience with a warm, fuzzy feeling, and never really challenges or surprises us."
tt0119217,"It's the individual moments, not the payoff, that make it so effective."
tt0119217,"You'd never guess this just-off-center movie was directed by indie hero Gus Van Sant. Maybe, like Will, he's casual about his gifts and feels no need to trot them out."
tt0119217,"Part character study, part redemptive drama, and all cheesy heart, it's Boston-baked melodrama, a little too gooey at times, but still pretty delicious."
tt0119217,"Matt Damon and Robin Williams give touching performances, but Gus Van Sant's filmmaking is surprisingly ordinary."
tt0119217,"Van Sant's direction is surprisingly static and conventional, which doesn't help this earnest, underwhelming misfire."
tt0087843,"A film of fatally flawed heroes, oversized passions, nation-building, and, inevitably, violence, America follows its characters from childhood to old age by way of the kind of grand-scale filmmaking that wouldn't be seen again until Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York. [2014 re-release]"
tt0087843,"It’s a funny, rousing, brilliant piece of work."
tt0087843,An epic poem of violence and greed.
tt0087843,"While The Godfather delivers certainty and a comforting dramatic resolution, Once Upon A Time In America delivers a profound kind of mystery. While Coppola's film delivers answers, Leone's asks questions. It lingers and plays on the mind; its meanings shift and change like a faded memory or a half-remembered dream."
tt0087843,A brilliantly detailed Lower East Side Jewish version of The Godfather.
tt0087843,"Watching the film takes some patience. You have moments where there's 10 seconds or more of silence in between dialogue. When it gets violent, it's not the psychotic glee we're used to from Quentin Tarentino and his acolytes, it's simply the way things were in that life, unvarnished and brutally honest."
tt0087843,"A film as epic and rich as Sergio Leone's imagination, Once Upon a Time in America sits at the head table of gangster movies."
tt0087843,"Once Upon a Time in America paints a portrait of the United States as a land of shadows and violence, yet one that nevertheless has an irresistible, romantic pull. [2014 re-release]"
tt0087843,"Although substantially shortened for its United States release, this violent drama still has the feel of an epic, as director Sergio Leone explores the seamiest byways of urban Americana through the story of two gangsters who start their partnership as Brooklyn kids in 1921 and tragically end it in the late '60s. Yet the story has gaps and many of the incidents have a flatness which suggest deeper flaws than cutting and trimming probably account for. [U.S. theatrical release]"
tt0087843,"Once Upon a Time in America remains the most “problematic” of Leone’s major pictures. It is enveloping, operatic and slightly mad. We can forgive the confusion and the non- synchronised dialogue. But to this day the misogyny remains indigestible. [2014 re-release]"
tt5311514,"The only way to understand it is to swim in it for yourself, feel your own heart braid around these two interwoven lives, and gaze up in awe at the silvery arc those falling stars trace across the sky."
tt5311514,"Part body-swap comedy, part long-distance romance, part... something else. If you only see one Japanese animated feature this year, see this one, and see it more than once."
tt5311514,"Prepare to be spirited away. A brain-scrambler to make hearts swell, Shinkai’s giddy romance brims with emotion and invention."
tt5311514,"This is a film which handles its high concept with confidence, and a winning balance of comedy and emotional punch."
tt5311514,"This vividly realized and emotionally satisfying feature ought to make Shinkai a household name — certainly in Japan, and with any luck, in other countries as well."
tt5311514,"Like all of Shinkai’s films, the richness of the light coats everything it touches with such an evocative hue of nostalgia that the plot only puts a damper on things (and there’s a lot of plot here)."
tt5311514,"For all its entertaining novelty, it is still many steps behind the magic, penetrating insights and profound humanity of the Japanese anime pantheon lead by Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru Hosoda."
tt5311514,There’s admittedly a certain pleasure in the deft fake-out that Shinkai executes here—most viewers will automatically make an assumption that’s ultimately proven wrong—but it comes at the cost of overall narrative incoherence.
tt5311514,"Even at its most outrageously bizarre, Your Name is bound together by a passionately romantic core."
tt5311514,"This thoroughly emo body-swap fantasia, a sizable hit on home turf, demonstrates that [Makoto Shinkai] inherited much of his [Hayao Miyazaki's] artistry and charm, but not yet his narrative mastery – nor, crucially, that magic that distinguishes lasting artworks from well-drawn ’toons for teens."
tt0045152,"Singin' in the Rain is a transcendent experience, and no one who loves movies can afford to miss it."
tt0045152,"With so many films dedicated to the agonies of filmmaking, Singin’ overflows with the pleasure of movie creation, stitching together references to Hollywood history with more alacrity than Tarantino. One of the highpoints of hoofin’ history but, more importantly, an unadulterated joy."
tt0045152,"With the names and versatile talents of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds, supported by lilting melodies, wonderful dancing and some very funny comedy, the show just can't miss being another MGM top-grosser."
tt0045152,"Watching Singin' in the Rain is an exuberant, magical experience – a journey deep into the heart of feel-good territory. Sitting through the film's 102 minutes is like ingesting a mood-altering drug. It's the perfect antidote to the blues and the blahs, and a way to bolster, enhance, and extend a natural high."
tt0045152,"In this picture, the screen’s greatest dancer contributes some of his art of choreography for the special pleasure of movie audiences."
tt0045152,"Incredible set pieces and songs that have entered the culture forever, this is also extremely well-paced and beautifully played. Truly one of the greatest musicals ever made."
tt0045152,Still the wittiest of all the MGM musicals of the 1940s and '50s.
tt0045152,"If you've never seen it and don't, you're bonkers."
tt0045152,"Concocted by Arthur Freed with showmanship know-how, it glitters with color, talent and tunes, and an infectious air that will click with ticket buyers in all types of situations."
tt0045152,"The nonsense is generally good and at times it reaches the level of first-class satiric burlesque. Adolph Green and Betty Comden may have tossed off the script with their left hands, but occasionally they come through with powerful and hilarious round-house rights."
tt1187043,"There's an unavoidable joie de vivre (symbolized by Rancho's meditative mantra ""All is well"") and a performance charm that make this one of the more naturally gregarious Bollywood imports."
tt1187043,3 Idiots takes a while to lay out its game plan but pays off emotionally in its second half.
tt1187043,"In writer-director Rajkumar Hirani's tuneful, enjoyable college comedy, 3 Idiots, Khan plays ""Rancho,"" an engineering student so brilliant that he barely has to break a sweat to place first in his class."
tt1187043,"The film's good points, though, are marred by a slow start and a nerve-jangling soundtrack."
tt0180093,No one interested in the power and magic of movies should miss it.
tt0180093,Aronofsky has fashioned a chilling vision that lives up to the caustic irony of its title and gives us a nightmare that is not lightly forgotten.
tt0180093,A powerful fable about love and addiction that manages to be darkly humorous when it isn't graphic or harrowing in the extreme.
tt0180093,"May be an elaborate stunt, a bungee jump, but even so, it's forceful enough to leave a rare palpitating residue."
tt0180093,It's one of the most beautifully unpleasant movies ever made - its reverse charge being that it is no fun at all.
tt0180093,"Aronofsky has given us a well-acted, gorgeously overwrought and luridly entertaining exploitation flick -- a midnight movie for future generations."
tt0180093,"While director Aronofsky pistol-whips your attention with his style, the characters (mostly relegated to human mannequins in Aronofsky's visual schemes) suffer big time."
tt0180093,"To be fair, Aronofsky has a knack for stylistic overkill, and his hammering onslaught is undeniably riveting, at first anyway."
tt0180093,"Too self-consciously dark, too aware of its long, murky, art-designed descent into the underbelly of America's addictive personality."
tt0180093,"In the end the movie goes nowhere a hundred movies haven't already been and tells us nothing we don't already know. It does so with so much violent energy, however, it's like four brutal years at film school crammed into an hour and a half."
tt0057565,"A sizzling, artistic crackerjack and a model of its genre, pegged on a harassed man's moral decision, laced with firm characterizations and tingling detail and finally attaining an incredibly colorful crescendo of microscopic police sleuthing."
tt0057565,"Miraculously, High And Low turns the mundane follow-through of police work into the stuff of white-knuckle suspense."
tt0057565,"Superb crime thriller. [07 Sep 1998, p.1N]"
tt0057565,"Few movies have ever been as subtly, methodically composed as High And Low, in which every shot reflects, to some degree, the dichotomy presented by its title."
tt0057565,"The most tension-filled ransom exchange sequence ever filmed works perfectly as the midpoint break between the two halves, which eventually begin to converge as a potent study on the psychological effects of income inequality disguised as a straight genre piece."
tt0057565,"High and Low is a masterful cinematic elevator connecting two warring social perspectives, finding a common ground between them in the pressurized corners of the classic crime drama."
tt0057565,"While not a masterpiece on par with Kurosawa's best work, High And Low is a fine example of his craft, and further proof that it's not a few masterpieces but the overall scope of a career that defines a great director."
tt0057565,"This lesser known Kurosawa feature is worth a look, with outstanding performances and stunning cinematography."
tt0057565,"It's not one of his masterpieces, but High and Low fully illustrates why Kurosawa is regarded as Japan's foremost director."
tt0057565,"Structurally, High and Low, which is remarkable in many ways--the camera work alone could serve as a primer in film technique--is quite a departure for Kurosawa."
tt0435761,"What MORE could audiences want from a movie than this hilarious, heartwarming entertainment for all ages?"
tt0435761,Toy Story 3 is a salute to the magic of making believe.
tt0435761,"Woody, Buzz and playmates make a thoroughly engaging, emotionally satisfying return."
tt0435761,"Toy Story 3 is very much a worthy entry in the series, a movie well worth making (and seeing). It continues the legacy. It just doesn't expand upon it."
tt0435761,"I laughed more (sincerely, full-throatedly) at Toy Story 3’s smart comedy than at any other film of the still-young summer movie slate."
tt0435761,"Dazzling, scary and sentimental."
tt0435761,"Toy Story 3 enhances the legacy of its brand while providing exceptional entertainment value for viewers of all ages, especially for those who favor the brighter, livelier 2-D iteration over the 3-D gimmick."
tt0435761,"Clearly, Pixar’s genius for adventurous storytelling continues unabated."
tt0435761,"TS3, like its predecessors, is a clever, engrossing adventure."
tt0435761,"This tertiary adventure delivers welcome yet nonessential fun, landing well after its creators have grown up and succeeded toying with more sophisticated stories."
tt8267604,"A social-realist blockbuster – fired by furious compassion and teeming with sorrow, yet strewn with diamond-shards of beauty, wit and hope."
tt8267604,"Capharnaüm is not without its issues. The director over-relies on the courtroom scenes and the movie’s message is heavy-handed at times. Yet, the sheer force of the filmmaking and its artful delivery overpowers sappy overreaching."
tt8267604,"While this is unquestionably an issue film, it tackles its subject with intelligence and heart."
tt8267604,"Makes for a generally powerful statement on human misery and grotesque inequality, though some third act creative decisions and maneuvers cause a wobble or two."
tt8267604,"It’s quietly absorbing and fitfully shocking as we experience the sights, sounds and smells of the streets where a one-year-old child can wander around alone without anyone stopping to wonder why."
tt8267604,Although the narrative is structured through a highly unbelievable instigating conceit — Zain is trying to sue his own parents in court for giving him life in the first place — Labaki lures such outstanding performances out of the almost entirely non-professional cast and sketches such a credible view of this wretchedly poor milieu that the flaws are mostly forgivable.
tt8267604,"If it doesn’t tie many (or any) of these thematic strands with a neat bow, that’s in the nature of a film that chooses raw dramatic power over narrative finesse."
tt8267604,"It’s a simplistic film in some ways, with a naive ending – but there is energy and vigour, too."
tt8267604,"Capernaum’s neorealist spirit is smothered by its sentimentality and endless string of indignities; it’s as if the film is operating as Zain’s trial defense, every moment making his case that it probably would have been better if he’d never been born."
tt8267604,"Capernaum is a movie that wants its audience to empathize with its protagonist so intensely that you agree he should never have been born. It’s a fascinating (if obviously counterintuitive) approach, but one that’s frustrated by the literalness with which Labaki unpacks it."
tt0086190,"'Return of the Jedi' is fun, magnificent fun. The movie is a complete entertainment, a feast for the eyes and a delight for the fancy. It's a little amazing how Lucas and his associates keep topping themselves."
tt0086190,"Best of all, a revisit with Jedi makes a viewer appreciate spectacle, presentation, mythology -- that, and the power of a bitchin' helmet to speak volumes in a language even an alien can understand. [Special Edition]"
tt0086190,"Less original than the first ""Star Wars"" and less resonant than ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" but packed with fast-paced action and downright cuddly Ewoks."
tt0086190,"Cuteness is the watchword here. The dark, eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is gone. Instead, for Return of the Jedi, we have good triumphing decisively over evil, a too-pat resolution to a love triangle, and walking teddy bears."
tt0086190,"The dialogue is repetitive (""I won't give in to the dark side of the Force!"" ""You will!"") and significant characters from earlier films -- notably bounty hunter Boba Fett and Yoda -- are dispatched without fanfare, and the whole business has a slightly rushed, perfunctory feel at the same time that it feels oddly attenuated."
tt0086190,"Brings things to an almost cheesy conclusion. Given the gripping, dark elements that creator George Lucas introduced in the two previous films, the third movie&#146;s outcome smacks of PG-rated populism rather than artistic fulfillment. But the experience is still highly entertaining. [Special Edition]"
tt0086190,"Ultimately, Jedi even backs off some of the more tantalizing possibilities suggested by the cliffhanging scenario of ""Empire."" This inhibition appears to grow out of consideration for the feelings of the juvenile audience, which can enjoy an abundance of thrills and close calls while resting assured that nothing catastrophic is going to be fall the heroes."
tt0086190,"Hamill is not enough of a dramatic actor to carry the plot load here, especially when his partner in so many scenes is really little more than an oversized gas pump, even if splendidly voiced by James Earl Jones."
tt0086190,Downright repetitive! [30 May 1983]
tt0086190,Return of the Jedi doesn't really end the trilogy as much as it brings it to a dead stop. The film...is by far the dimmest adventure of the lot.
tt0062622,This is the way this ground-breaking monument was meant to be seen: in mind-boggling 70mm.
tt0062622,"Its special effects are used so seamlessly as part of an overall artistic strategy that, as critic Annette Michelson has pointed out, they don't even register as such, and thus are almost impossible to trivialize, a feat unmatched in movies."
tt0062622,"Only a few films are transcendent, and work upon our minds and imaginations like music or prayer or a vast belittling landscape...Alone among science-fiction movies, 2001 is not concerned with thrilling us, but with inspiring our awe."
tt0062622,"A masterpiece that can still leave you dizzy with wonder. As much as any movie ever made, this visionary science-fiction tale of space travel and first contact with extraterrestrial life is a spellbinding experience."
tt0062622,"Its faults - sketchy narrative, overblown abstraction - are counterbalanced by its gripping engagement between man and machine, and its rhapsodic wonder at heaven and earth and the infinite beyond."
tt0062622,Still the grandest of all science-fiction movies.
tt0062622,"With 2001, Stanley Kubrick proved that a sci-fi movie could be philosophical rather than pulpy, profound rather than pedantic."
tt0062622,"Watching this film demands two qualities that are sadly lacking in all but the most mature and sophisticated audiences: patience and a willingness to ponder the meaning of what's transpiring on screen. 2001 is awe inspiring, but it is most definitely not a ""thrill ride."" It is art, it is a statement, and it is indisputably a cinematic classic."
tt0062622,"Beloved for many different reasons, including its scrupulous scientific accuracy, its vast reach from ""The Dawn of Man"" to the next stage of human evolution, its unrivaled integration of musical and visual composition, its daring paucity of dialogue and washes of silence, its astonishingly creative psychedelic sequence and its still-gorgeous pre-digital special effects."
tt0062622,"The movie is so completely absorbed in its own problems, its use of color and space, its fanatical devotion to science-fiction detail, that its is somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring."
tt0338013,"Not only (Kaufman's) most accessible and romantic screenplay, it's his most complete. The third act works like a charm and pulls all his themes, characters and conflicts together beautifully."
tt0338013,"A wildly imaginative, hugely entertaining tour de force that asks big questions about life and love and fate while never ceasing to fully engage the viewer."
tt0338013,"Watching Eternal Sunshine, you don't just watch a love story -- you fall in love with what love really is."
tt0338013,"If films about coping with memory loss and/or reverse-order storytelling now constitute a mini-genre, then Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is arguably the best of the lot."
tt0338013,"Kaufman may be counting on the audience's will, insistence and yearning to create a coherent love story from the shards and shrapnel he provides us."
tt0338013,It's a baroque and intermittently brilliant brain twister so convoluted that it inevitably deposits the viewer in an alternate universe.
tt0338013,"Chases so many ideas that it threatens to spin out of control. But with our multiplexes stuffed with toxic Hollywood formula, it's a gift to find a ballsy movie that thinks it can do anything, and damn near does."
tt0338013,This is unlike any other film I have seen... it's a great romance. It's willingness to flout conventions and eschew formulas is just one of many things to celebrate about this charmingly eccentric movie.
tt0338013,"There aren't many performers who can deliver the fullness of heart that such a plot demands, but Winslet is one of them. [22 March 2004, p. 102]"
tt0338013,"For most of Eternal Sunshine, I found myself fighting off Gondry's hyperactive intrusions in order to get at the melancholia at its core. Fortunately, the idea behind this movie is so richly suggestive that it carries you past Gondry's image clutter."
tt0105236,"You may not like the terms Tarantino sets, but you have to admit he succeeds on them."
tt0105236,"A brutal movie, brutal in all the right ways -- brutally stark, brutally funny, brutally brutal. [30 Oct 1992]"
tt0105236,"Reservoir Dogs sizzles - it's dynamite on a short fuse, and you watch it with mesmerized fascination, simultaneously attracted and repelled by the explosion you know will come."
tt0105236,The truth is that for all the controversy there really isn&#146;t that much violence in Reservoir Dogs. The reason people were so affected was because the film shows you the true impact of its violence.
tt0105236,"Most of the movie is Actors Acting: gifted guys (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn) running nattering riffs on familiar lout themes. [16 Nov 1992]"
tt0105236,Too lingeringly creepy to ignore. [23 Oct 1992]
tt0105236,"It's unclear whether this macho thriller does anything to improve the state of the world or our understanding of it, but it certainly sets off enough rockets to hold us and shake us for every one of its 99 minutes."
tt0105236,"Though its reach sometimes exceeds its grasp, Tarantino has created a movie with all the gritty punch of a .44 in the belly."
tt0105236,"Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologietic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect. [27 Oct 1992]"
tt0105236,"Tarantino's debut directing job acknowledges the sloppiness and silences that are typically squeezed out of most crime films, but we get the point early on and the remainder is macho posturing. [23 Oct 1992]"
tt2106476,"Mikkelsen, who is not given to sympathetic roles, has never been better. This is cinema that sinks its claws into your back."
tt2106476,"For anyone with even a halfway developed sense of justice The Hunt may prove stressful, frustrating, even enraging, but it’s also an unbelievably effective watch, that, if nothing else signals an undeniable return to form for Vinterberg, and yet another blistering performance from Mikkelsen. See it, if only for the debates it will cause afterward."
tt2106476,"Propelled by Mads Mikkelsen’s shattering performance as the blameless man whose life threatens to be destroyed, the film is superbly acted by a cast that never strikes a false note or softens the impact with consolatory sentiment."
tt2106476,It’s a pretty conventional “Lifetime Original Movie” sort of story. But co-writer/director Thomas Vinterberg (“Dear Wendy”) makes it work by building a sense of frustrating unease into it all.
tt2106476,"It is forthright, powerful, composed and directed with clarity and overwhelming force, yet capable of great subtlety and nuance."
tt2106476,Vinterberg keeps us guessing right up to and after an end shot that suggests how tough some viral rumours are to shake off.
tt2106476,"Beautifully performed and tough as nails, Vinterberg's social drama could not be any more timely."
tt2106476,"What a knotty, frighteningly real drama The Hunt is."
tt2106476,"The film is in part an exceedingly black comedy that parodies proper society's eager, self-righteous naïveté on the subject of its children."
tt2106476,Mikkelsen impresses here as a warm-hearted man who finds himself caught up in a situation way beyond his control.
tt0056172,"In short, they don't make 'em like this one anymore. Viewing it is like taking a time machine to a movie age that was more naive than our own in some ways, more sophisticated and ambitious in others."
tt0056172,"What a bold, mad act of genius it was, to make Lawrence of Arabia, or even think that it could be made."
tt0056172,"It's perhaps only because it can't be seen in its full glory on television that ""Lawrence"" isn't ranked more highly on some recent all-time ""best film"" lists. But it belongs near the very top. It's an astonishing, unrepeatable epic."
tt0056172,"Riveting from beginning to end, featuring stellar performances, amazing cinematography, and a story without a trace of fat, the film does everything an epic is supposed to do - and more."
tt0056172,David Lean's splendid biography of the enigmatic T.E. Lawrence paints a complex portrait of the desert-loving Englishman who united Arab tribes in battle against the Ottoman Turks during WWI.
tt0056172,"Released in 1962, it was pretty clearly the most intelligent spectacular within living memory. On its 40th anniversary, it's even better."
tt0056172,"Lawrence is back on the big screen, and it simply demands to be seen. Yes, again."
tt0056172,"The movie manages both senses of scale—the intimate and the expansive—with equal majesty, merging them into something moving, mesmerizing, and poetic, in a way only Lean movies could really manage."
tt0033467,"Citizen Kane is a great motion picture. Great in that it was produced by a man who had never had any motion picture experience; great because he cast it with people who had never faced a camera in a motion picture production before; great in the manner of its story-telling, in both the writing of that story and its unfolding before a camera; great in that its photographic accomplishments are the highlights of motion picture photography to date, and finally great, because technically, it is a few steps ahead of anything that has been made in pictures before."
tt0033467,"Its surface is as much fun as any movie ever made. Its depths surpass understanding. I have analyzed it a shot at a time with more than 30 groups, and together we have seen, I believe, pretty much everything that is there on the screen. The more clearly I can see its physical manifestation, the more I am stirred by its mystery."
tt0033467,"Welles displays touches of genius in the handling of his story. His cast, made up of players from his Mercury Theatre group, respond like sensitive musicians to the movements of the conductor’s baton."
tt0033467,"While I acknowledge that Kane is a seminal masterpiece, I don't think it's the greatest motion picture of all time. Even so, there's no denying the debt that the movie industry owes to Welles and his debut feature. Motion picture archives and collections across the world would be poorer without copies of this film, which will forever be recognized as a defining example of American cinema."
tt0033467,The sheer audacity and delight Welles takes in flouting conventions and inventing new ones is what keeps it fresh.
tt0033467,It happens to be a first-class film of potent importance to the art of motion pictures...a triumph for Orson Welles.
tt0033467,"In spite of some disconcerting lapses and strange ambiguities in the creation of the principal character, Citizen Kane is far and away the most surprising and cinematically exciting motion picture to be seen here in many a moon. As a matter of fact, it comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood."
tt0033467,"It is a work of art created for grown people by grown people...Orson Welles treats the audience like a jury, calling up the witnesses, letting them offer the evidence, injecting no opinions of his own. He merely sees that their stories are told with absorbing clarity. Unforgettable are such scenes as the spanning of Kane's first marriage in a single conversation, the silly immensity of the castle halls which echo the flat whines of Susan."
tt0033467,"I still stare at it, amazed and entertained, but dwarfed by the very idea of attempting to untangle the crow’s nest that has formed through the film’s ever-expanding histories. And what continuously stupefies me is that time works no miracles on this particular film: Scenes remain familiar, but the narrative seems to shift every time I return to it."
tt0033467,"Sublime moments, of which the most extraordinary must still be Everett Sloane, playing Kane's former business manager Mr Bernstein, remembering the girl in the white dress on the Jersey ferry: ""I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all – but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl."" I'll bet a week hasn't gone by when I haven't thought about that line and pictured the girl so clearly that she has become a false memory of the movie itself."
tt0044741,"Over the years I have seen ""Ikiru"" every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think."
tt0044741,"Like “Stray Dog” and “Drunken Angel,” it illuminates a reeling society while telling a story of deep human emotion."
tt0044741,"A thoughtful, existential meditation about the meaning of life and what constitutes a life well-lived, Ikiru is almost guaranteed to prod the viewer to examine his or her own mortality and ponder how, in the end, the scales will tip."
tt0044741,The genius of Akira Kurosawa’s Ikiru is the way this deeply sentimental film continually deflates sentimentality.
tt0044741,"This is the flip side to his samurai films, an introspective, naturalistic contemporary drama combining progressive social criticism with a universal humanist message."
tt0044741,Kurosawa performs a tour-de-force in keeping a dramatic thread throughout and avoiding the mawkish. It is technically excellent with a telling Occidental-type musical score.
tt0044741,"Kurosawa’s eclectic style is a delight: his striking, varied compositions reflecting the old man’s journey from darkness to some kind of light right until the moving finale."
tt0044741,"Akira Kurosawa's talent for analysis, interpretation and projection is again apparent in ""To Live."" [30 Jan 1960, p.22]"
tt0044741,"Ikiru wows for its complicated interrogation (and innovation) of subjective, cinematic experiences of time and memory, but lulls in its commemoration of a wealthy, privileged man who finally decides to care after it’s absolutely confirmed he has no time left to live."
tt0044741,"If it weren't so confused in its story-telling, it would be one of the major postwar films from Japan. As it stands, it is a strangely fascinating and affecting film, up to a point—that being the point where it consigns its aged hero to the great beyond."
tt0053125,"There’s a superabundance of sparkling, often marvellously terse one-liners (when asked what the “O” stands for, Thornhill’s resigned and emotionally relevant answer is, “Nothing”) – and, my, how wittily Grant delivers them."
tt0053125,"This is Hitchcock's longest film and also his most self-referential. Little jokes abound about art and artifice, role play and reality, duty and duplicity and each viewing reveals something new to enhance the pleasure of watching the Master of Suspense at his most mischievous and assured."
tt0053125,This film is pure entertainment.
tt0053125,"The picture is hugely pleased with itself, but it’s too funny and expertly calibrated to mind in the least. Both Hitchcock and Grant raise relaxed confidence to masterpiece level here."
tt0053125,[A] sublime classic.
tt0053125,"North by Northwest is the Alfred Hitchcock mixture - suspense, intrigue, comedy, humor. Seldom has the concoction been served up so delectably."
tt0053125,"NORTH BY NORTHWEST has everything--thrills, suspense, mystery, and black humor, as well as dark undertones of sexual exploitation and covert political machination."
tt0053125,"A great film, and certainly one of the most entertaining movies ever made, directed by Alfred Hitchcock at his peak."
tt0053125,The lines and the expert manipulation of the principals are tributes to the outstanding talents of Messrs. Lehman and Hitchcock.
tt0053125,North by Northwest is also surprisingly forthright when it comes to sexual matters. There aren't many euphemisms or double entendres in the interaction between Thornhill and Eve.
tt0053604,"The underlying seriousness of MacLaine's performance helps anchor the picture--it raises the stakes, and steers it away from any tendency to become musical beds."
tt0053604,"Absolutely brilliant. It's funnier, sadder and cooler on the big screen."
tt0053604,"It's still luminous, 52 years on."
tt0053604,The Apartment represents Wilder at his most complete - seamlessly weaving the lighthearted and the serious without encountering a snarl or tangle.
tt0053604,Delightful comedy romance with a clutch of note-perfect performances.
tt0053604,"The Apartment captured one of the singular images of early '60s America; the immense office (designed by Alexander Trauner) in which the human workers, seated behind endless, perfectly aligned rows of identical desks, appear completely subordinate to the dehumanizing mechanisms of conformity and efficiency."
tt0053604,"Second half of the picture is loosely constructed and tends to lag as the rahers go through their paces in over-extending the major plot angle. Most of the time, it’s up to director Wilder to sustain a two-hour-plus film on treatment alone, a feat he manages to accomplish more often than not, and sometimes the results are amazing."
tt0053604,The Apartment is an important and provocative film.
tt0053604,"Production and direction wise, Wilder sustains his usual excellence. But his story is controversial and I am not one of those who can quite see The Apartment as the great comedy-drama he evidently intended it to be. He oversteps the bounds of good taste."
tt0053604,"The quintessential New York movie – with exquisite design by Alexandre Trauner and shimmering black-and-white photography – it presented something of a breakthrough in its portrayal of the war of the sexes, with a sour and cynical view of the self-deception, loneliness and cruelty involved in ‘romantic’ liaisons."
tt0052357,"Vertigo, which is one of the two or three best films Hitchcock ever made, is the most confessional, dealing directly with the themes that controlled his art."
tt0052357,"All great art has within it some irreducible, inexplicable element, beyond its cleverness and craft. Such is the hold Vertigo has. This strange, frustrating story of a haunted pervert, Hitchcock's Byronic opus, still evades capture, and refuses to be something it's not."
tt0052357,"Vertigo is one of the great movies about movies, and about Hitchcock’s own way with them."
tt0052357,"Profound, penetrating and unfathomable rather than (quite) perfectly formed art. Vertigo pioneered that camera effect, known as the dolly zoom, whereby the viewer (the point of view is always Stewart’s) appears to fall into an infinite abyss while remaining quite still...The film itself is that abyss, and we’re still falling into it and for it."
tt0052357,"Vertigo also combines in an almost unique balance Hitchcock’s brash flair for psychological shocks with his elegant genius for dapper stylishness. Like Psycho, it ends in an “o”, or maybe “oh!” The ancient house adjoining the Bates motel in Psycho certainly has an unearthly similarity to San Francisco’s creepy old McKitterick Hotel in Vertigo. [Rerelease]"
tt0052357,"This dizzyingly intricate film reveals new facets each time you see it. We leave Vertigo unsettled, like Scottie, who ends up on the edge of a precipice. Hitchcock is daring us to leap. He has prepared the ultimate fix for a cinema junkie: a movie to get lost in."
tt0052357,Alfred Hitchcock’s rich and strange masterwork.
tt0052357,Gripping throughout with frame upon frame of standout images and superb performances from the two leads.
tt0052357,An artistic triumph for the master of mystery.
tt0052357,"Unfortunately, even that mastery is not enough to overcome one major fault, for the plain fact is that the film’s first half is too slow and too long."
tt0211915,"Joyous. This is a film that will put a goofy grin on your face from the opening frame, through to the credits, out into the lobby, the whole way home, and possibly even till you fall asleep."
tt0211915,"A feel-good movie, in the absolute best sense."
tt0211915,"A movie for aesthetically hungry moviegoers: wildly amusing, sometimes sardonic and always touching. There's so much here, and all of it delightful."
tt0211915,A film that wants you to get happy.
tt0211915,"At two hours, the movie is probably 15 minutes too long -- the final half-hour in particular could have used some trimming -- but complaining about having too much of a good thing makes one sound like a grouch."
tt0211915,"A big-hearted French movie that shines with wit, beauty, humor, sunshine and the love of love."
tt0211915,"A slick, sweet, fast-paced, feel-good romantic fantasy that's fairly irresistible if you can keep your cynicism in check for a couple of hours."
tt0211915,The screen is saturated with Gallic whimsy and the romance of Montmartre in the person of Am&#233;lie.
tt0211915,"The lanky, wide-eyed Tautou is so phenomenally charming -- her smile could sweeten vinegar -- as to make Amelie irresistible."
tt0211915,"The ease with which the perky, big-eyed heroine ingeniously succeeds in improving the lot of everyone around her and the painterly manner in which reality in every inch of the frame is ""improved"" constitute both the ""quirky"" charm and the pure fishiness of the film."
tt0036775,"This shrewd, smoothly tawdry thriller, directed by Billy Wilder, is one of the high points of nineteen-forties films. Barbara Stanwyck’s Phyllis Dietrichson—a platinum blonde who wears tight white sweaters, an anklet, and sleazy-kinky shoes—is perhaps the best acted and the most fixating of all the slutty, cold-blooded femmes fatales of the film-noir genre."
tt0036775,To describe the story is to miss the nuances that make it tantalizing.
tt0036775,"Film noir is the most intoxicating of Hollywood cocktails, and none is more potent than Double Indemnity...It breaks the rules of filmmaking with breathtaking confidence and is all the more satisfying for"
tt0036775,"Film noir at its finest, a template of the genre, etc. Billy Wilder in full swing, Barbara Stanwyck's finest hour, and Fred MacMurray makes a great chump."
tt0036775,"I love Double Indemnity because it's about a couple who are cheap and greedy, but achieve a kind of tragic heroism; because it has one of the great father-son relationships (although they aren't actually father and son); because it's a thoroughly cynical thriller redeemed by just a fading touch of romance. And it also has a trio of superb performances."
tt0036775,"It is in the clandestine scheming of the sex-hungry man and the cunning woman, in the methodical method of their plotting the husband's murder that Wilder builds the suspense that pounds and drives to a staggering climax. There are at least three instances of suspense so great that the heart almost stops beating. The highest praise one can give the Sistrom production is to say that it is like a masterpiece of mystery fiction coming vividly to life on the screen. As you cannot lay down such a book until it has been read through, neither then can you shake off the witchery exerted over you by this film from its very opening scene."
tt0036775,"Indemnity is rapidly moving and consistently well developed. It is a story replete with suspense, for which credit must go in a large measure to Billy Wilder’s direction."
tt0036775,Superlative crime yarn adapted with precision and skill from the classic James M. Cain novel.
tt0036775,"Visually drab and flabby around the edges. Its seamy tale of murder is not layered in any way; what you see (or, in Wilder’s case, hear) is what you get."
tt0036775,"Such folks as delight in murder stories for their academic elegance alone should find this one steadily diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length...But the very toughness of the picture is also the weakness of its core, and the academic nature of its plotting limits its general appeal."
tt0066921,"A chilling classic, the movie is a scabrous satire about human deviance, brutality, and social conditioning that has remained a visible part of the ongoing public debate about violence and the movies."
tt0066921,"Kubrick's liberal, anti-authoritarian reading of Anthony Burgess's very Catholic allegorical novel is morally confused but tremendously powerful... No serious moviegoer can afford to ignore it."
tt0066921,"It demands thought, compels the attention, and refuses to be dismissed. And, for that reason, A Clockwork Orange must be considered a landmark of modern cinema."
tt0066921,"Kubrick's contributions are his wit and his eye. The wit, too much at times, is as biting as in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and the production, while of another order, is as spectacular as in ""2001."" [11 Feb 1972]"
tt0066921,"A much-maligned and misunderstood classic, this is one of Kubrick's finest movies."
tt0066921,"It seems to me that by describing horror with such elegance and beauty, Kubrick has created a very disorienting but human comedy, not warm and lovable, but a terrible sum- up of where the world is at... Because it refuses to use the emotions conventionally, demanding instead that we keep a constant, intellectual grip on things, it's a most unusual--and disorienting--movie experience."
tt0066921,"A brilliant nightmare... The film employs outrageous vulgarity, stark brutality and some sophisticated comedy to make an opaque argument for the preservation of respect for man's free will - even to do wrong."
tt0066921,"The first punk tragicomedy, a chain-whipped cartoon meditation on Good, Evil, and Free Will that is as seductive as it is tasteless. That Kubrick misjudged the distance between comedy and cruelty seems to be unarguable."
tt0066921,It is just plain talky and boring. You know there's something wrong with a movie when the last third feels like the last half.
tt0066921,"A very bad film--snide, barely competent, and overdrawn--that enjoys a perennial popularity, perhaps because its confused moral position appeals to the secret Nietzscheans within us."
tt0093058,"Elliptical, full of subtle inner rhymes...and profoundly moving, this is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since ""Dr. Strangelove,"" as well as the most horrific; the first section alone accomplishes most of what ""The Shining"" failed to do."
tt0093058,"As brutally unsparing as ""Platoon"" was, it was ultimately warm and embracing. Kubrick's film is about as embracing as a full-metal-jacketed bullet in the gut. [29 June 1987]"
tt0093058,"Kubrick's harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric new film about Vietnam, is going to puzzle, anger and (I hope) fascinate audiences as much as any film he has made to date... A film of immense and very rare imagination."
tt0093058,"What makes the film stunning is less its metaphorical scheme than its cinematic style. Always a matter of flowing camera movement, Kubrick has photographed much of the action with long ""traveling shots"" that capture time and space as a seamless whole, not fractured into the bits and pieces of standard editing techniques. [26 June 1987]"
tt0093058,"May be the best war movie ever made...Different is Kubrick's artistry and control, and his almost perverse, but philosophically progressive, refusal to impart to chaos a coherent narrative contour."
tt0093058,"An intense, schematic, superbly made Vietnam War drama."
tt0093058,"The film has undeniable power, but it's an unusual and unsettling power, a product of a collision between red-hot material and the cool serenity with which Kubrick observes and accepts it. [26 June 1987]"
tt0093058,"A perversely fascinating movie--one that answers no questions, offers no hope and has little meaning. In a way this is perfect for what the film has to say about war, but you find yourself numbed and apathetic as the film progresses."
tt0093058,"The concluding image of men silhouetted against the dying flares of explosives, as they march to the raucous refrain of the Mickey Mouse Club theme, is masterly, but leaves a viewer curiously discomfited. Whereas ""Platoon"" shattered civilian complacency about that war, Full Metal Jacket is merely numbing. [26 June 1987]"
tt0093058,"By most standards of conventional film narrative, this movie is a mess. [25 June, 1987, p.22(E)]"
tt0086250,"Scarface is one of those special movies, like ""The Godfather,"" that is willing to take a flawed, evil man and allow him to be human."
tt0086250,"Perfomances are excellent, and despite its moralistic conclusion, the film has since become de rigueur viewing for crack barons, who know a good shoot-em-up when they see one."
tt0086250,"A beautiful, at times poetic exercise in excess from Brian De Palma."
tt0086250,"Scarface is the most stylish and provocative - and maybe the most vicious - serious film about the American underworld since Francis Ford Coppola's ""Godfather."""
tt0086250,"It is a serious, often hilarious peek under the rock where nightmares strut in $800 suits and Armageddon lies around the next twist of treason."
tt0086250,"Scarface is a grandiose modern morality play, excessive, broad and operatic at times."
tt0086250,"Scarface is a B- movie with singularly silly psychological pretensions: its neo-primitivism is to the complex moral cosmos of Francis Coppola's ""Godfather"" saga as Disney is to Dickens. [09 Dec 1983]"
tt0086250,"It plays like a crude ""Godfather"" parody, the sort that might amuse as a 10-minute sketch on ""Saturday Night Live,"" but curdles and collapses as a 143-minute film. [09 Dec 1983]"
tt0086250,"Brian De Palma dedicates this 1983 feature to Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht, authors of the 1932 original, though I doubt they would find much honor in his gory inflation of their crisp, 90-minute comic nightmare into a klumbering, self-important, arrhythmic downer of nearly three hours."
tt1255953,"A staggering political drama that could put you in mind of the intimate sweep of Bernardo Bertolucci, Incendies feels like a mighty movie in our midst."
tt1255953,The movie is a bumpy road of twists that leads to a revelation that has the shock and force of Greek tragedy.
tt1255953,"The movie doesn't quite jell, but you'll feel its sting for hours."
tt1255953,"Although the film runs more than two hours, the story is so compelling and the production so beautifully controlled that we are gripped by the characters' quest right up to the shocking end of the story."
tt1255953,A devastating mystery thriller from Quebec filmmaker Denis Villeneuve that grabs you hard and won't let go.
tt1255953,"The climax is a little too clever and far-fetched-an unnecessarily neat finale for a movie that works fine when dealing in broad strokes, some of which are nothing short of masterful."
tt1255953,"Azabal is superb, conveying Nawal's fiery presence, determination and mounting bitterness. The impressive cast includes non-professionals from Jordan, where Incendies was filmed."
tt1255953,Incendies vaults Denis Villeneuve to the status of serious director.
tt1255953,"While the film will likely stick with viewers, it's ultimately a tossup what they'll remember most: the stunning buildup, or the massive letdown."
tt1255953,"Nawal's travails are more in the vein of a Latin American soap opera than Greek tragedy, and Jeanne and Simon's climactic, genuinely god-awful discovery plays like artistic sleight-of-hand rather than the profoundly tautological revelation it aspires to be."
tt0113277,"Stunningly made and incisively acted by a large and terrific cast, Michael Mann's ambitious study of the relativity of good and evil stands apart from other films of its type by virtue of its extraordinarily rich characterizations and its thoughtful, deeply melancholy take on modern life."
tt0113277,One of the most intelligent crime-thrillers to come along in years.
tt0113277,"A sleek, accomplished piece of work, meticulously controlled and completely involving. The dark end of the street doesn't get much more inviting than this."
tt0113277,A stunning crime drama that shares its protagonists' rabid attention to detail and love of adrenalin.
tt0113277,"Under a director with less vision and ambition, Heat could have been just another routine crime drama, but Mann brings such an edge to the proceedings that the threadbare story takes on a new urgency."
tt0113277,"It didn't sound like fun to us, either, but we were wrong; Heat scores on many fronts...The plot, though it seems to ramble, builds suspense with deft precision, and the action set pieces are triumphs."
tt0113277,"It's a monster of a movie, and it gets unwieldy."
tt0113277,"We're not watching McCauley and Hanna anymore; we're watching De Niro and Pacino trying to out-insinuate each other. For a few moments, Heat truly has some."
tt0113277,A cool and rather detached movie...Heat generates lots of energy but gives off little light.
tt0113277,"Ultimately, though, the movie never transcends the limitations of its Hemingwayesque, men-with-men attitudes."
tt8503618,"Director Thomas Kail’s filmed version of the blockbuster musical Hamilton, available Friday on the Disney Plus streaming service, surely is the greatest translation, democratization and preservation of any Broadway show, ever."
tt8503618,Kail’s camera captures actors’ intimate faces during key moments in a way impossible for theater-goers and incorporates audience reaction to create an electric filmed version.
tt8503618,"Entertaining, energetic and unfailingly smart, this is theatre at the highest level, performed by a cast without a weak link. You can’t say no to this."
tt8503618,"Hamilton stands as a reminder of how hard it is to get a democracy right, and how necessary it is to keep trying, as long as it takes."
tt8503618,"This is Hamilton as you always wanted to see it, and it always will be."
tt8503618,"One of the show’s more obvious lessons is that history is a living, breathing entity, and that the cyclical rise-and-fall narratives of leaders and empires can be studied and recounted in ways that uncover bold new patterns of meaning. This film, a straightforward capture of a momentous work of art, illuminates those patterns in ways both sobering and thrilling."
tt8503618,There's a good reason behind every technical choice — closeups and moments of stillness intensify the intimacy of the more introspective songs; nimble camerawork juices up the contentious cabinet battles; wide shots and stunning overheads add to the scope of momentous scenes like the fatal duels that punctuate the story.
tt8503618,"This is a tremendously entertaining trip through the births of both America and the musical form, with each institution given a lightly revisionist torque by Miranda, who approaches the material with a scholar’s dedication to detail and a showman’s slick wit."
tt8503618,Hamilton the film is just OK.
tt8503618,"The film aims to be more intimate, but it frequently deprives audiences of the show’s ingenious spatial design. Still, this original cast is so charismatic — and Miranda’s ultra-dense, dizzyingly clever book and lyrics are so effective — that they maintain our attention even when the edit feels like one of those live sporting events, as a producer sits in the control booth choosing between cameras in the moment, rather than planning out the shoot in advance."
tt1049413,"Winsome, touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever, the gorgeously rendered, high-flying adventure is a tidy 90-minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it."
tt1049413,A captivating odd-couple adventure that becomes funnier and more exciting as it flies along.
tt1049413,"The first 10 minutes of Up are flawless; the final 80 minutes, close enough. (Though, note this: Do not see Up in 3-D. It's inessential to the tale and altogether distracting.)"
tt1049413,"A lovely, thoughtful, and yes, uplifting adventure."
tt1049413,"Extending the patented Pixar mix of humor and heart, Up is the studio's most deeply emotional and affecting work."
tt1049413,"This is another masterwork from Pixar, which is leading the charge in modern animation."
tt1049413,"By all means, see Up in its 3-D incarnation: The cliff drops are vertiginous, and the scores of balloons--bunched into the shape of one giant balloon--are as pluckable as grapes."
tt1049413,"Up emerges as a gentle hymn to adventure of both the soaring, storybook variety and the smaller, less obvious kind -- the perilous, unpredictable and richly rewarding journey of ordinary, everyday life."
tt1049413,"We will be comparing Up with classics like ""The Wizard of Oz"" for years to come."
tt1049413,"Up is not as transcendent as last year's ""WALL-E,"" and doesn't rank near the top of Pixar's pantheon of great features, but it's a solid (and in some ways innovative) fantasy adventure that mixes comedy, action, and drama into a satisfying whole."
tt0056592,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a product of American realism, and it is a rare and worthy treasure."
tt0056592,Storytelling doesn't get much better than this.
tt0056592,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a major film achievement, a significant, captivating and memorable picture that ranks with the best of recent years."
tt0056592,"As Mulligan so deftly demonstrates, the story is in the characters, their failings and fragility, their heroism and nobility of spirit. It's in the depiction of heart-breaking cruelty and heart-warming humanity. It's in the innocence of a child's world overshadowed by the evil that adults do."
tt0056592,One of the year's most fetching and affecting pictures.
tt0056592,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a faithful adaptation of one of the 20th century's most important American works of literature. It is also a masterpiece in its own right. This is one of those rare productions where everything is in place - a superior script, a perfect cast, and a director who has a clear vision and achieves what he sets out to do."
tt0056592,"There is not only artistry in the development of the story - there is beauty, sympathy and emotional appeal in almost every scene."
tt0056592,Their charming enactments of a father and his children in that close relationship that can occur at only one brief period are worth all the footage of the film.
tt0056592,"A hauntingly nostalgic portrayal of childhood mischief set in a racially divided Alabama town in the 1930s. If the film's tone sometimes seems overly righteous, it's offset by a poetic lyricism that is difficult to resist embracing."
tt0056592,"To Kill a Mockingbird, set in Maycomb, Alabama, in 1932, uses the realities of its time only as a backdrop for the portrait of a brave white liberal."
tt0070735,"The style here is so seductive and witty it's hard to pin down. It's like nothing else I've seen by Hill, and at times, it almost reminds me of Jacques Tati crossed with Robert Altman. It's good to get a crime movie more concerned with humor and character than with blood and gore; here's one, as we say, for the whole family."
tt0070735,"In an age when films such as Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven are revered for their trickery, The Sting remains the definitive con artist comedy: as irresistible and ingenious as the scheme that hooks in Doyle."
tt0070735,"The Sting is the most purely enjoyable film in Oscar history – and that, I think, puts it in the most valuable American film-making tradition of all."
tt0070735,"The Sting has all the signs of a blockbuster. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are superbly reteamed, this time as a pair of con artists in Chicago of the ’30s, out to fleece a bigtime racketeer brilliantly cast with and played by Robert Shaw. George Roy Hill’s outstanding direction of David S. Ward’s finely-crafted story of multiple deception and surprise ending will delight both mass and class audiences. Extremely handsome production values and a great supporting cast round out the virtues."
tt0070735,"The Chicago locations are well used by veteran director George Roy Hill, and the wonderful 30s movie style (lots of horizontal and vertical wipes, flipping screens, irises in and out) enhances the sense of good, harmless, nostalgic fun."
tt0070735,"The Sting represents one of the most popular, widely-loved films to win Best Picture in the last half-century and an example of grand entertainment."
tt0070735,"A lot of the other period details aren't too firmly anchored in time, but the film is so good-natured, so obviously aware of everything it's up to, even its own picturesque frauds, that I opt to go along with it. One forgives its unrelenting efforts to charm, if only because The Sting itself is a kind of con game, devoid of the poetic aspirations that weighed down ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."""
tt0070735,But the look of a movie is not as important as how it feels. The Sting feels like a cold shower. One dashes into it primarily because of its superior cast.
tt0070735,"The plot has many twists, few surprises, and one gaping hole, which becomes apparent only after you walk out of the theater and have a chance to think. But pure popcorn like this is hardly worthy of serious analysis...Fortunately, the stars have not lost their charm and authority."
tt0070735,"The Sting was not made to be taken seriously, but many people may find it difficult even to enjoy casually. It lacks the elements that could have given it true drive. [31 Dec 1973, p.50]"
tt1832382,"The drama it might remind you most of, oddly enough, is ""Six Degrees of Separation,"" also about the snowballing connections between unlikely people. And as in that urban clash, the bedrock of it all is social responsibility, ever crumbling and rebuilding. A total triumph."
tt1832382,It's a frantic microcosm of life itself.
tt1832382,"Beyond the impeccable performances and direction, it's foremost an exceptional piece of screenwriting, so finely wrought that the drama seems guided by an invisible hand."
tt1832382,"Sophisticated and universal yet deeply intimate, A Separation is an exquisitely conceived family drama that has the coiled power of a top-notch thriller."
tt1832382,"The members of the cast represent ensemble, naturalistic acting at its finest."
tt1832382,"Barriers both transparent and persistently present encase the characters of A Separation, constricting them in ways social, cultural, religious, familial, and emotional."
tt1832382,A Separation is a landmark film. No way will you be able to get it out of your head.
tt1832382,"What's fascinating is how the various issues - religious or practical - are played out in these two quite different families, yet always come down to irreconcilable differences between rebellious women and their stiff-necked, controlling men."
tt1832382,"Together and apart, Hatami and Maadi are magnetic. Hatami, a star in Iranian cinema, lets us see Simin's intelligence and defiant sense of self-worth often with nothing more than a gesture."
tt1832382,"It is a rigorously honest movie about the difficulties of being honest, a film that tries to be truthful about the slipperiness of truth."
tt0017136,"Seeing it is a time-bending experience, a way of visiting the past and glimpsing the past's idea of the future. A masterpiece of art direction, the movie has influenced our vision of the future ever since, with its imposing white monoliths and starched facades."
tt0017136,You've seen the rest; now see the best.
tt0017136,An awesome cinema spectacle.
tt0017136,"Does what many great films do, creating a time, place and characters so striking that they become part of our arsenal of images for imagining the world."
tt0017136,"Trashy and glorious, the restored Metropolis is a pop epic for the ages."
tt0017136,"Metropolis has a place in world history as well as in the annals of fantasy. Adolf Hitler was said to have loved it, and Lang eventually fled Germany for Hollywood when the Third Reich wanted him to run its movie industry. Few movies of any era offer so much varied food for thought, cinematically and politically. Its new restoration is a major motion-picture event."
tt0017136,"Departing from a masterful manipulation of space, Lang transforms the futuristic city of the title into a field of dreams centered on death and sexuality."
tt0017136,"Metropolis retains its power to overwhelm, trouble and move because it is connected to the deep anxieties of modern life as if by a high-voltage cable."
tt0017136,"After half a century, does the story hold up? Eh, pretty much. In the end, the story doesn't really matter that much as this is really a vehicle for the amazing visuals."
tt0017136,"What ultimately saves the film from both silliness and ponderousness is not its simplistic social message, not its now-stale theme, nor its disappointing characterizations, but rather the dazzling cinematic (and theatrical) bag of tricks which Lang and company employed to keep things moving."
tt0095016,"Not only is it a thrill-a-minute ride, but it has one of the best film villains in recent memory, a hero everyone can relate to, dialogue that crackles with wit, and a lot of very impressive pyrotechnics."
tt0095016,"The result is a foot-stomping rouser. Where else can you get a cop in his underwear boogalooing with skyscraper terrorists? [15 July 1988, Life, p.4D]"
tt0095016,"A firepowered, blood-drenched action picture that doesn't let up."
tt0095016,"Slick, glossy, overblown, implausible. [15 July 1988, Daily Notebook, p.E1]"
tt0095016,"Has everything but a personality. [15 July 1988, Friday, p.A]"
tt0095016,Has to be the most excessive film around. It piles every known element of the action genre onto the flimsy story. [15 July 1988]
tt0095016,"A triumph of slick direction and lowbrow thrills, marred but not spoiled by a sour aftertaste."
tt0095016,"As a grand flourish of cinematic technique, it is awesome; as a human drama, it is disgusting and silly, a mindless depiction of carnage on an epic scale. [15 July 1988, Calendar, p.6-1]"
tt0095016,"What Willis proves in Die Hard is that it is not one you can ease through, especially if your preparation runs more to body building than to character building. [July 25, 1988]"
tt0095016,"On a technical level, there's a lot to be said for Die Hard. It's when we get to some of the unnecessary adornments of the script that the movie shoots itself in the foot."
tt0119488,"A movie bull's-eye: noir with an attitude, a thriller packing punches. It gives up its evil secrets with a smile."
tt0119488,"A juicy noir stew of amorality that's the best thing since ""Chinatown."""
tt0119488,"A tough, gorgeous, vastly entertaining throwback to the Hollywood that did things right. As such, it enthusiastically breaks most rules of studio filmmaking today."
tt0119488,An irresistible treat with enough narrative twists and memorable characters for a half-dozen films.
tt0119488,"L.A. Confidential, with an exceptional ensemble cast directed by Curtis Hanson from James Ellroy's densely plotted novel, looks to be the definitive noir for this particular time and place."
tt0119488,"See L.A. Confidential. Be astonished at discovering anew how very, very satisfying movies can still be. And how fine that can feel."
tt0119488,"Once L.A. Confidential gets rolling, it hits with power, stunning in its sweep and surprising with its plot twists."
tt0119488,L.A. Confidential is at the same time his (Hanson) most personal movie and Hollywood filmmaking at its best.
tt0119488,"This sleek adaptation of James Ellroy's dauntingly complex novel has the black-and-white tabloid soul of an old ""Confidential"" magazine."
tt0119488,"A glamorous, alluring entertainment that revels in the artifice of Hollywood while exposing its corrupt heart, L.A. Confidential pays stylish homage to some of the great film noirs of the distant and recent past."
tt0075314,A brilliant nightmare and like all nightmares it doesn't tell us half of what we want to know.
tt0075314,One of Scorsese's most influential and disturbing films on the big screen. [20th Anniversary Release]
tt0075314,Its deeply anarchic sensibility has kept Taxi Driver fresh all these years. [20th Anniversary Release]
tt0075314,"An undeniably brilliant, nightmarish portrait of one man's personal hell."
tt0075314,"You either love it or you love it; in any case, Martin Scorsese's history-making scald is truly a phenomenon from another day and age."
tt0075314,It hasn't aged so much as triumphantly metastasized. [20th Anniversary Release]
tt0075314,"Scorsese’s direction always keeps us uncomfortably close to Travis’ subjectivity, whether we’re prowling night time Manhattan or gazing into a glass of Alka-Seltzer until the whole world disappears into the healing hiss."
tt0075314,"Hitchcockian unease permeates the film, but so too does a Godardian use of space and a Bressonian focus on obsession heighten the mounting sense of dread. These elements are groovy for film buffs but are mere icing on the proverbial cake; you don’t need to be in the know to relish Scorsese’s mastery of the form, and what may astonish even more than the creative prowess is how compulsively entertaining the results are."
tt0075314,"Acting of this sort is rare in films. It is a display of talent, which one gets in the theater, as well as a demonstration of behavior, which is what movies usually offer. Were Mr. De Niro less an actor, the character would be a sideshow freak."
tt0075314,Perhaps the most formally ravishing-as well as the most morally and ideologically problematic-film ever directed by Martin Scorsese.
tt0097576,"It's a beautiful machine, thought out and revved up to the last detail, with no other purpose but to delight - and it delights. [24 May 1989, Daily Notebook, p.E1]"
tt0097576,"The Harrison Ford-Sean Connery father-and-son team gives Last Crusade unexpected emotional depth, reminding us that real film magic is not in special effects."
tt0097576,"The relaxed and confident Crusade is the first Jones outing to benefit from actual characterizations. [24 May 1989, Life, p.1D]"
tt0097576,"It is just as well that Last Crusade will indeed be Indy's last film. It would be too sad to see the series grow old and thin, like the James Bond movies."
tt0097576,"Fully up to, as well as virtually indistinguishable from, its predecessors&#133; The guarantee of Indiana Jones is that the pace never varies and the tone never changes; when you've had enough, you can feel free to leave. [24 May 1989, Tempo, p.1]"
tt0097576,"More amusing than exciting. [19 June 1989, p.28]"
tt0097576,"You can't roll monstrous boulders straight at audiences any more and have a whole theater-full duck and gasp with fright--and pleasure. We may be plumb gasped out. And although Harrison Ford is still in top form and the movie is truly fun in patches, it's a genre on the wane. [24 May 1989, Calendar, p.6-1]"
tt0097576,"The action simply doesn't have the exhilarating, leaping precision that Spielberg gave us in the past... The joyous sureness is missing. [12 June 1989]"
tt0097576,"The first of Spielberg's films to make us feel heavy in our seats, the first to leave us sitting, passive and uninvolved, on the outside. Watching it, you feel that nearly anyone could have directed it."
tt0097576,"Mechanical, soulless."
tt0208092,"The convoluted story is an excuse for comical tricks of the camera, fractures of chronology, acid punch lines and amusingly excessive performances. (In this latter category, Pitt, so deep into his character that you can smell him, wins the day gloriously.)"
tt0208092,"Snatch is admittedly superficial, if not downright disposable. More importantly, though, the movie is also fantastic, cheeky fun."
tt0208092,"Even if it's not quite as lighter than air as its predecessor, Snatch remains a lethal diversion."
tt0208092,"The movie was snatched, all right, and Ritchie is the culprit."
tt0208092,"Since the main reason I go to movies is to engage with characters, I prefer ""The Pledge,"" the film opening today by Madonna's first husband, Sean Penn, rather than this stylish fluff by her second spouse."
tt0208092,"It all feels rather laddish and belabored, but it will eat up 90 minutes of your time without making you regret the loss."
tt0208092,Mr. Ritchie seems to be stepping backward when he should be moving ahead.
tt0208092,"The problem with all this don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it dramaturgy is that ultimately everything is sacrificed for effect. When you're dealing, as Ritchie is, with explosions of real violence and viciousness, the hyperslick technique can't accommodate the real pain that comes with the territory, or ought to. What we're left with is a cackling amorality -- not a philosophy of life, just a posture."
tt0208092,It takes a very clever schoolboy to make a movie as elaborately empty as Guy Ritchie's Snatch.
tt0208092,"For those who care, Madonna has found her match in Guy Ritchie, whose absence of talent when it comes to the film medium is equal to her own."
tt8579674,"1917 is Mendes’s most purely ambitious and passionate picture since his misunderstood and under-appreciated Jarhead of 2005. It’s bold, thrilling film-making."
tt8579674,"1917 is an expertly crafted and emotionally exhausting thrill-ride behind enemy lines. Gloriously shot, deftly paced, and striking in its gruesome recreation of the time and place, Sam Mendes’ 1917 wisely never loses sight of the smaller, intimate elements in a fast-paced story with immense scale and action."
tt8579674,"The film belongs to Chapman and more than anyone, MacKay, a 27-year-old Londoner with the long bones and baleful eyes of a porcelain saint or a lost Caulkin brother. His Lance Corporal Schofield isn’t just a surrogate Everyman; he’s hope and fear personified, and you couldn’t look away if you wanted to."
tt8579674,"Even if the film is mostly hitting familiar notes in terms of story and theme, it expresses a concise, focused and expertly managed vision with which there’s little to quibble, and the extraordinary style represents the fruition of a long-imagined dream on the part of many directors and cinematographers. From now on, when the discussion turns to great works of cinematography and camera operating, 1917 will always have to be high on the list."
tt8579674,"Mendes is intent on bringing a sense of breathless derring-do to a war only known for its doomed futility. And he loads onto it a one-take challenge, a rolling-back and slowly-swerving camera, using the sleight of hand which distinguishes the best action cinema of this kind."
tt8579674,"The clock is always ticking in 1917, and even as MacKay is offering a heartbreaking study in restrained emotion, he’s still at least moving towards the end goal of his terrible task. There’s no time to pause, even for great beauty, a lesson that even 1917 is often loathe to honor."
tt8579674,"Astonishing as his filmmaking can be at times, it’s Mendes’ attention to character, more than the technique, that makes 1917 one of 2019’s most impressive cinematic achievements."
tt8579674,The movie is more successful as a thriller than as a thoughtful examination of war and its horrors; Mendes seems less interested in bigger ideas about the nightmare of battle and its effects on his characters than he is in Hitchcockian audience manipulation.
tt8579674,"1917 is a rattling wonder of form, an audacious undertaking that nonetheless bobbles or cheats on a few occasions."
tt8579674,"There are times when the nonstop visual momentum lends 1917 the feel of a virtual-reality installation, and others when the simulation of raw immediacy slips to reveal the calculated construct underneath."
tt1745960,"As much as “Top Gun: Maverick” whips from a technical, visceral, thrill-making, supersonic-level, the entire endeavor and every little moment of introspection, suffering and determination is all the more accentuated, strengthened and fist-pumpingly good because you care so damn much about the story, the people and their very human concerns."
tt1745960,"Joe Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) matches his well-established architectural precision with suitably nostalgic but never pandering emotionality, while Cruise commands the screen in a performance that leverages his multimillion-dollar star wattage to brighten the entire film."
tt1745960,"Stainless where the original was musty, neutered where the original was soft-core (there isn’t a single gratuitous shower scene in this sequel, let alone three of them), and structured like an immaculate pop song where the original moved like freeform jazz, “Maverick” sounds like a major regression from an age where summer movies didn’t always play safe. But let’s not forget that Cruise is the only guy whose summer movies still vehemently refuse to do that."
tt1745960,"In a lot of ways, Top Gun: Maverick is the platonic ideal of a film sequel, constantly in dialogue with the original project, and committed to growing and expanding upon that source material."
tt1745960,"Director Joseph Kosinski (TRON: Legacy) revels in the sonic-boom rush of their many flight scenes, sending his jets swooping and spinning in impossible, equilibrium-rattling arcs. On the ground, too, his camera caresses every object in its view, almost as if he's making a rippling ad for America itself."
tt1745960,Top Gun: Maverick is a rare sequel that is not only better than the original but retroactively makes Top Gun's story altogether deeper.
tt1745960,"Top Gun 2 reboots the original film's heart-pounding aerial action, infectiously cheesy character drama and don't-think-about-it-too-much military fetishism in a winning spectacle of cinematic escapism."
tt1745960,Top Gun: Maverick is an out-of-bounds blast of afterburner fumes and thrillseeker highs that's sure to please audiences looking for a classic summer blockbuster.
tt1745960,The film fully surrenders to the grandiose fun that’s marked the best of Tom Cruise’s recent star vehicles and reaffirms Joseph Kosinski as a blockbuster craftsman par excellence.
tt1745960,Top Gun: Maverick does exactly what its intended audience wants it to do – pile on the airborne thrills and steely military heroics without knotting things up with too much moralising or complex character development.
tt0363163,"As Hitler, Bruno Ganz ignites the screen with every appearance."
tt0363163,"One of the best war movies ever made, Downfall is a powerful and artistically masterful re-creation of the last days of the Third Reich."
tt0363163,"In every aspect, his film is superbly made."
tt0363163,"A meticulous, spellbinding, provocative depiction of the final days of the Third Reich."
tt0363163,"As a piece of acting, Ganz’s work is not just astounding, it’s actually rather moving. But I have doubts about the way his virtuosity has been put to use."
tt0363163,"Not so much a Hitler movie as a portrait of a totalitarian machine's spiritual and emotional collapse, Downfall is a cumulatively powerful Goetterdammerung centered on the last 10 days of the bunkered Fuehrer and those around him."
tt0363163,Downfall and Bruno Ganz are deserving of Oscars they will not get.
tt0363163,Downfall's overstuffed melodrama juggles countless subplots and a small army of characters who manage to make an impression in spite of limited screen time.
tt0363163,"If I respect Downfall more than I was enthralled by it, that's because its portayal stops short of revelation. Once you witness Hitler's denial, the film has little more to say about him."
tt0363163,Downfall may be grimly self-important and inescapably trivializing. But we should be grateful that German cinema is more inclined to normalize the nation's history than rewrite it.
tt0059578,"The second film in Leone's Dollar trilogy finds the Italian director in better form than in A Fistful of Dollars. For a Few Dollars More has better writing, superior production values, and more characters who aptly complement Eastwood's stoic Man with No Name."
tt0059578,"While it doesn’t have the lunatic fervor of The Good, The Bad’s climatic cemetery shootout, For A Few Dollars more feels like its successor’s equal, which is about as great a compliment as I can bestow."
tt0059578,"A hard-hitting western with upper-case values out of the busy Italo stable, this is a topnotch action entry."
tt0059578,"It has a wealth of marvellous Western imagery, grotesque-comic business (Van Cleef striking a match on seething baddie Klaus Kinski’s hunchback), Ennio Morricone’s baroque score, iconic stars and unforgettable supporting faces."
tt0059578,"Leone's artful editing of close-ups to communicate the characters' spatial relationships is always a pleasure, and here he unveils his stylistic signature—extreme close-ups of the characters' eyes—as Van Cleef surveys the villain's wanted poster."
tt0059578,"Here is a gloriously greasy, sweaty, hairy, bloody and violent Western. It is delicious."
tt0059578,"Not as stylish as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but a significant step forward from A Fistful of Dollars, with the usual terrific compositions, Morricone score, and taciturn performances, not to mention the ubiquitous flashback disease."
tt0059578,"The fact that this film is constructed to endorse the exercise of murderers, to emphasize killer bravado and generate glee in frantic manifestations of death is, to my mind, a sharp indictment of it as so-called entertainment in this day."
tt0372784,"For Christopher Nolan to turn Batman Begins into such a smart, gritty, brooding, visceral experience is astonishing. Truly, Batman does begin again."
tt0372784,"Significantly grittier than previous Bat-beginnings, this finds new things to do with, and say about, a character who's been around since 1938."
tt0372784,"Of course, a Batman movie is nothing without a Bruce Wayne, and, by a mile, Bale is the best of a lot that has ranged from the square-jawed slapstick of Adam West to the more dedbonair stylings of Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney."
tt0372784,"The buildup is steadily engrossing. That's because Nolan keeps the emphasis on character, not gadgets. Gotham looks lived in, not art-directed."
tt0372784,"In Batman Begins, Christian Bale gives us the best Bruce Wayne that has ever graced the screen."
tt0372784,"Ambitious, well made but not exactly rousing."
tt0372784,"Nolan and his co-screenwriter David Goyer can only press the big buttons so hard—it's still an old-school superhero summer movie, the plotting tortuous, the characters relegated to one-scene-one-emotion simplicity, the digitized action a never ending club mix of chases and mano a manos."
tt0372784,"Begins, at two-hours-plus, is a nonstarter."
tt0372784,"The young Welsh-born actor Christian Bale is a serious fellow, but the most interesting thing about him--a glinting sense of superiority--gets erased by the dull earnestness of the screenplay, and the filmmakers haven't developed an adequate villain for him to go up against."
tt0372784,"Nolan's effort is not dishonorable, but what it needs, and doesn't have, is a Joker in the deck--some antic human antimatter to give it the giddy lift of perversity that a bunch of impersonal explosions, no matter how well managed, can't supply."
tt0053291,"Wilder's 1959 comedy is one of the enduring treasures of the movies, a film of inspiration and meticulous craft, a movie that's about nothing but sex and yet pretends it's about crime and greed."
tt0053291,"Key to its success - along with its vivid characters and brilliant performances - is the snappy pace throughout. Non-stop gags, invention, twists and comic incident flow, as Joe and Jerry - sexy Curtis and screamingly funny Lemmon - elude mob boss George Raft by wriggling into an all-girl jazz band, with Josephine and Daphne’s legendary drag act taking in amorous adventures, seductive deceptions and madcap pursuits."
tt0053291,"Some Like It Hot, directed in masterly style by Billy Wilder, is probably the funniest picture of recent memory. It's a whacky, clever, farcical comedy that starts off like a firecracker and keeps on throwing off lively sparks till the very end."
tt0053291,"Reinvented by Wilder and co-screenwriter co-writer IAL Diamond, Some Like It Hot is effortlessly fluent, joyous and buoyant: a high-concept comedy that stays as high as a kite, while other comedies flag. ""Nobody's perfect"" is the last line. Wilder, Lemmon, Curtis and Monroe come pretty close."
tt0053291,"Some Like It Hot is another supersonic, breakneck, belly-laugh comedy that should be a block-busting bonanza at the box office. It should be a proof that when the making of pictures is taken out of the bands of men-of-measured-merriment and handed over to men whose only purpose is to create amusement, they are still the world's best means of entertainment. Billy Wilder, who produced, directed and wrote the screenplay, with I.A.L. Diamond, was on the front burner all the way."
tt0053291,"The funniest comedy I’ve seen in years. There aren’t many of the hundred and four minutes of running time that doesn’t find the audience laughing its head off at the antics of Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe."
tt0053291,Billy Wilder’s 1959 comedy is still perfect all these years later.
tt0053291,"But it’s the precision-tooled plot fashioned by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond that holds it together, creating the perfect farcical playground. Brilliant performances, wondrous comic timing and the greatest pay-off line ever written: this one’s still red hot."
tt0053291,"Magnificently paced and terrifically funny at nearly every turn, Some Like It Hot was imbued with an inherent distrust of capitalism and big business that Wilder regularly expressed in an only slightly covert manner."
tt0053291,"Let's face it. Two hours is too long a time to harp on one joke. But Billy Wilder, who produced, directed and collaborated with I. A. L. Diamond on this breeziest of scripts, proves once again that he is as professional as anyone in Hollywood. Mr. Wilder, abetted by such equally proficient operatives as Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, surprisingly has developed a completely unbelievable plot into a broad farce in which authentically comic action vies with snappy and sophisticated dialogue."
tt10272386,"The best film about the wages of aging since Amour eight years ago, The Father takes a bracingly insightful, subtle and nuanced look at encroaching dementia and the toll it takes on those in close proximity to the afflicted."
tt10272386,"The Father is about the suffering of old age, the importance of connection, the sick encroaching of an affliction, and ultimately, death. It doesn’t sugarcoat things, despite its sugarcoated exterior. Like its French counterpart, Michael Haneke’s Amour, it’s not an easy watch, but it’s a necessary one, a film that examines the very essence of our humanity."
tt10272386,"The Father is an act of understanding, radical in its toughness and its generous artistry."
tt10272386,"The Father is a chamber piece, but it has the artistic verve to keep twisting the reality it shows us without becoming a stunt."
tt10272386,"For a movie that follows a character’s perspective while remaining aware of his shortcomings, The Father marks a modest and involved debut from Zeller."
tt10272386,"The Father exists for no discernible reason other than to render an inexplicably cruel element of the human condition in a recognizable way, and to do so in a way that only good art can."
tt10272386,"Hopkins methodically strips away every quality we’ve come to expect from him—the refinement, the silver tongue, the imposing intensity he lent Lecter and Nixon and Titus—until there’s nothing left but frailty and distress. In doing so, he helps convey the full tragedy and horror of dementia: the way it can make someone almost unrecognizable to themselves and their loved ones."
tt10272386,"It’s a difficult, often quite brutal, viewing experience, as it needs to be given the subject matter, not only because of the fractured storytelling but because of the devastating lead performance from Hopkins."
tt10272386,"On the whole, The Father incorporates what could have just been a storytelling gimmick and infuses it with such sorrow, grace and even the occasional dark joke that it becomes a profound exploration of how we say goodbye to someone dear to us — even though they have not yet really gone."
tt10272386,"Despite the efforts of Hopkins and an outstanding ensemble, Zeller can’t divorce his feature directorial debut from its theatrical origins."
tt0042192,"The movie's strength and weakness is Anne Baxter, whose Eve lacks the presence to be a plausible rival to Margo, but is convincing as the scheming fan. When Eve understudies for Margo and gets great reviews, Mankiewicz wisely never shows us her performance; better to imagine it, and focus on the girl whose look is a little too intense, whose eyes a little too focused, whose modesty is somehow suspect."
tt0042192,"The stinging bon mots occasionally sound handcrafted rather than raspingly spontaneous, but aspiring actress Anne Baxter’s rise to the top over the corpse of her supposed idol, Bette Davis, remains rousing and endlessly amusing."
tt0042192,Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Hart might even find themselves outclassed by the dazzling and devastating mockery that is brilliantly packed into this film.
tt0042192,"If you're not interested in all the backstage tittle-tattle, just settle back and enjoy a film whose script is studded with barbed and quotable bons mots, the finest ever part by suave cad George Sanders and a memorable cameo by Marilyn Monroe as an aspiring starlet (practically everyone was playing variations of themselves)."
tt0042192,All About Eve possesses one of the best screenplays ever to grace the silver screen. It also has one of the best performances by an actress in the history of Hollywood features.
tt0042192,"Set in the Broadway jungle rather than among the ‘sun-burnt eager beavers’ of Hollywood, Joseph L Mankiewicz’s film dissects the narcissism and hypocrisy of the spotlight as sharply as Wilder’s, but pays equal attention to the challenges of enacting womanhood."
tt0042192,"All About Eve is not only a brilliant and clever portrait of an actress, it is a downright funny film, from its opening scene to the final fadeout."
tt0042192,"ALL ABOUT EVE is the consummate backstage story, a film that holds a magnifying glass up to theatrical environs and exposes all the egos, tempers, conspiracies and backstage back-biting that make up the world of make-believe on Broadway."
tt0042192,"All About Eve is one of the greatest movies about theatre—an idea that, in itself, opens an ironic abyss into which Mankiewicz spelunks with an impish, riotous aplomb."
tt0042192,"All About Eve has substance in virtually every dramatic and romantic mood, which have been given proper shading and projection by producer Darryl F. Zanuck and Mankiewicz."
tt0993846,"A touch too long, yet never slack, at three hours, TWOWS benefits from independent funding, Scorsese’s brass balls and an A-grade cast’s turbulent improvisations to emerge as an epic, boldly broad screwball comedy about the state of America, then and now."
tt0993846,"As hot and wet as freshly butchered meat: every second, every frame of its three-hour running time is virile with a lifetime’s accumulated genius."
tt0993846,"As an sensory experience, 'WOWS' is mostly a terrifically visceral one, a full throttle fast and furious bacchanalia of drug-fueled madness. But as a scathing indictment of American rapacity, it isn't particularly deep or resonant beyond the exterior."
tt0993846,"A big, unruly bacchanal of a movie that huffs and puffs and nearly blows its own house down, but holds together by sheer virtue of its furious filmmaking energy and a Leonardo DiCaprio star turn so electric it could wake the dead."
tt0993846,"Nearly as extravagant as the characters it depicts, Martin Scorsese's comic, operatically-scaled film is, on a moment-by-moment basis, often madly entertaining due to its live-wire energy, exuberant performances and the irresistible appeal of watching naughty boys doing very naughty things."
tt0993846,"The Wolf of Wall Street, for all its abundant appeal, is no Greek tragedy. It lacks the wildness of Taxi Driver, the jeopardy of GoodFellas and the anguish of Raging Bull. Far better to view this as a stylistic homage, a remastered greatest hits compilation, an amiable bit of self-infringement."
tt0993846,"Scorsese never digs too deeply under the skin of these reprehensible playboy douchebags, and there are times where the swooping photography, smash-and-grab editing and toe-tapping soundtrack conspire to almost – almost – make us like them. But when the film’s cylinders are firing, it’s impossible not to be dragged along."
tt0993846,"There's no question about the efficacy of Scorsese's filmmaking prowess, only that he never knows -- or doesn't care -- to slow down and deepen the material."
tt0993846,"Martin Scorsese's keyed-up, irreverent tone frequently fails to distinguish itself from the grunting arias sung by the oily paragons of commerce his film evidently intended to deflate."
tt0993846,"If you’re going to invest three hours watching a movie about a convicted stock swindler, it needs to be a whole lot more compelling than Martin Scorsese’s handsome, sporadically amusing and admittedly never boring — but also bloated, redundant, vulgar, shapeless and pointless — Wolf of Wall Street."
tt6966692,"Green Book is a real crowd pleaser — aside from the banter between the oppositely-minded characters, it has clear heroes and villains. The writers do manage to sneak a few nuances in, especially when discussing Shirley feeling out of place in both the white and black communities."
tt6966692,"There’s something almost inevitable about these real-life characters getting a feature showcase, so unusual, engaging and inspiring is their journey from antagonism to deep friendship."
tt6966692,"Featuring a pair of terrific performances by Viggo Mortensen as a goombah with a heart of gold and Mahershala Ali as multilingual composer-musician Don Shirley, the story may be unique, yet it goes pretty much exactly the way you might expect."
tt6966692,"It’s an obvious but enjoyable period piece — and a throwback to another era of Hollywood filmmaking, resurrected in the 21st century with two of the best actors working today, who elevate this didactic form of storytelling above the market standard for schmaltz."
tt6966692,"Green Book is an on-the-nose social commentary that is told with such craftsmanship, earnestness, and comedic expertise that you’re still excited to go along for the ride."
tt6966692,"Peter Farrelly manages to respect the severity of the characters’ social context while ensuring that Green Book never steps outside its protagonists’ relationship, a delicate balancing act that credibly makes a feel-good, effervescent comedy out of its thorny subject matter without ever sanitizing it."
tt6966692,"Green Book invites you to come along for the ride, the comfort food, the socio-political sparks and the laughs."
tt6966692,Distinctive and amusing turns by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali make Peter Farrelly’s first solo feature outing a lively and likable diversion.
tt6966692,"There’s clearly a more nuanced drama to be made from this story but given the scale, there’s still a lot here to praise."
tt6966692,"Green Book is a thoroughly predictable and conventional true-life drama, but at least Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali make for decent company along the road."
tt0055031,"On the point of the fundamental issue in the Nazi war guilt trials that were held in Nuremberg, Germany, after World War II, Stanley Kramer, the producer-director, has pinned a powerful, persuasive film. The major weakness, perhaps, of the whole thing is that it is inevitably compressive and sometimes glib. The strength and wonder of it is that it manages to say so much that still needs to be said."
tt0055031,"Though unrelentingly bleak, Judgment at Nuremberg is absorbing from beginning to end."
tt0055031,"There are no surprises in the direction, and Abby Mann's screenplay plays the expected tunes, but there's enough conviction on display to reward a patient spectator."
tt0055031,"Judgment at Nuremberg is twice the size of the concise, stirring and rewarding production on television's Playhouse 90 early in 1959. A faster tempo by producer-director Stanley Kramer and more trenchant script editing would have punched up picture."
tt0055031,"Gavin Lambert summed it up: An all-star concentration-camp drama, with special guest-victim appearances."
tt0055031,"On the whole, Director Kramer has almost arrogantly exceeded his judicial warrant. He has also crudely mismanaged both actors and camera, and has carelessly permitted several reels of fat to accumulate around the movie's middle."
tt0055031,"Grandstanding 1961 courtroom drama about the Nazi war trials, courtesy of producer-director Stanley Kramer, breast-beating screenwriter Abby Mann, and an all-star cast—watchable enough on its own terms, but insufferably glib next to something like Shoah."
tt0089881,The triumphant masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa's fertile twilight.
tt0089881,"In Ran, the horrors of life are transformed by art into beauty. It is finally so moving that the only appropriate response is silence."
tt0089881,"One of the 10 best films ever made, period."
tt0089881,"Kurosawa pulled out all the stops with Ran, his obsession with loyalty and his love of expressionistic film techniques allowed to roam freely."
tt0089881,"Stands separate from the rest, in a pantheon, a true cinematic masterwork of sight, sound, intelligence, and most importantly--passion."
tt0089881,"In many respects, it's Kurosawa's most sumptuous film, a feast of color, motion and sound: Considering that its brethren include ""Kagemusha,"" ""The Seven Samurai"" and ""Dersu Uzala,"" the achievement is extraordinary. [01 Dec 2000, p.26]"
tt0089881,It’s a dazzlingly successful addition to [Kurosawa's] distinguished career.
tt0089881,"The Japanese title means chaos, and that is what is let loose when a powerful king foolishly tries to release the reins of power, in the hopes of enjoying a peaceful old age."
tt0089881,"A magisterial film, but not quite a great one."
tt0089881,"Save for one startlingly staged battle sequence. . .might as well have been titled ""Also Ran."""
tt0112641,"Scorsese tells his story with the energy and pacing he's famous for, and with a wealth of little details that feel just right."
tt0112641,"Whether or not Casino meets your expectations, it delivers the rush you only get from an audacious gamble."
tt0112641,"Several flaws, mostly minor, keep Casino on a plateau slightly below that of the director's best (Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas)."
tt0112641,A 2-hour classic wrongfully stretched into three.
tt0112641,"Visually impressive, splendidly performed, thematically significant, this is a movie in full possession of every key cinematic asset except one -- a solid script. Casino is a polished vehicle with an untuned engine."
tt0112641,Simultaneously quite watchable and passionless.
tt0112641,"One of the ironies of Casino is that even though Scorsese is interested in the story's wider implications, he focuses so much energy on that unsavory romantic triangle that he and the film lose sight of the larger issues."
tt0112641,"As anthropology, it's fascinating, and everything about the production is first class. But the human drama at the heart of this movie is stillborn."
tt0112641,"It's an ambitious film -- but also a scattered, unfocused one."
tt0112641,Roll past this casino.
tt0120382,A gemlike picture crafted with rare and immaculate precision.
tt0120382,"Delicately subversive, hypnotically sardonic, full of terror, banality and wafer-thin lyricism."
tt0120382,That rare cinematic experience-a movie so close to pure perfection that it seems a shame to spoil it by even reading a review beforehand.
tt0120382,"Achieves a kind of beauty through its overlaying enigmas, and Carrey."
tt0120382,Hollywood's smartest media satire in years--and a breakthrough for Jim Carrey.
tt0120382,"A smart, engaging movie."
tt0120382,"Warm, affecting and refreshingly shtickless, he (Carrey) occupies center stage here through sheer, beguiling force of personality."
tt0120382,A cool indictment of television's near-irresistible pandering to the inner peeping tom.
tt0120382,"Undeniably provocative and reasonably entertaining, The Truman Show is one of those high-concept movies whose concept is both clever and dumb."
tt0120382,"It's unusually provocative and challenging for a Hollywood movie and, surprisingly, allows the audience to piece things together without too much external direction."
tt0469494,"There Will Be Blood is ferocious, and it will be championed and attacked with an equal ferocity. When the dust settles, we may look back on it as some kind of obsessed classic."
tt0469494,"There Will Be Blood is, in fact, not a historical saga; rather, it's an absurdist, blackly comic horror film with a very idiosyncratic satanic figure at its core."
tt0469494,Daniel Day-Lewis stuns in Paul Thomas Anderson's saga of a soul-dead oil man.
tt0469494,An enthralling and powerfully eccentric American epic.
tt0469494,"Boldly and magnificently strange, There Will Be Blood marks a significant departure in the work of Paul Thomas Anderson."
tt0469494,"For a story that's all about the harnessing of fateful chthonic forces, Paul Thomas Anderson has dug deeper than ever before, and struck black gold."
tt0469494,"For bleakness, the movie can't be beat -- nor for brilliance."
tt0469494,"The film is above all a consummate work of art, one that transcends the historically fraught context of its making, and its pleasures are unapologetically aesthetic. It reveals, excites, disturbs, provokes, but the window it opens is to human consciousness itself."
tt0469494,"Ambitious, deeply flawed and studded with sequences that achieve pure, majestic greatness."
tt0469494,"Unfortunately, the film's final third is poorly focused and, while there is a clear conclusion, it feels strangely hollow."
tt0457430,"This is like no movie you've seen before, a haunting mixture of horror, history and fantasy that works simultaneously on every level."
tt0457430,"This intense film, a mix of horror, fantasy, and history that convinces on all those levels and mixes them up with dizzying brio, is a searing cinematic experience, a beautiful, terrifying vision from writer-director Guillermo del Toro."
tt0457430,"Literally and figuratively marvelous, a rich, daring mix of fantasy and politics."
tt0457430,"Pan's Labyrinth Like his terrific 2001 ""The Devil’s Backbone,"" Mexican horrormeister Guillermo del Toro's new movie offers us both real-life and fantastical monsters, and if you know his work, you won't waste time figuring out which to root for."
tt0457430,A brilliant work of the imagination capable of truly seizing and igniting our fantasies.
tt0457430,"This is a true fairy tale, and one of the finest fantasy pictures ever made, but please do not take your young children to see it unless you want them to be scarred for life."
tt0457430,The lack of family friendliness does not diminish what del Toro has achieved with this magical motion picture.
tt0457430,"Suspended between the brutally graphic and flights of lyrical fancy, Pan's Labyrinth unfolds with the confidence of a classical fable, one that paradoxically feels both timeless and startlingly new."
tt0457430,"The performers are all good with Baquero poised and beautiful as Ofelia and Verdu vital and spirited as the rebellious Mercedes. Lopez gives an extraordinary performance as the bestial captain, an irredeemable villain to rank with Ralph Fiennes' Nazi in ""Schindler's List."""
tt0457430,"There's plenty of blood -- both literal and figurative -- coursing through the veins of Pan's Labyrinth, a richly imagined and exquisitely violent fantasy from writer-director Guillermo del Toro."
tt0105695,"Simultaneously heroic and nihilistic, reeking of myth but modern as they come, it is a Western for those who know and chrish the form, a film that resonates with the spirit of films past while staking out a territory quite its own. [7 Aug 1992]"
tt0105695,"Clint Eastwood has crafted a tense, hard-edged, superbly dramatic yarn that is also an exceedingly intelligent meditation on the West, its myths and its heroes."
tt0105695,"The cast is universally strong. Hackman, Freeman and Harris don't do anything they haven't done before, but the roles suit their personae to a degree where they approach archetypal status."
tt0105695,"This dark, melancholic film is a reminder -- never more necessary than now -- of what the American cinema is capable of, in the way of expressing a mature, morally complex and challenging view of the world. [7 Aug 1992]"
tt0105695,"Unforgiven is the most provocative western of Eastwood's career, and with Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris along for the ride, it's also the most potently acted."
tt0105695,It's the actor/director's best movie - and the best Western by anybody in over 20 years. [7 Aug 1992]
tt0105695,"Plays out its drama with enough old-fashioned sobriety to lend the proceedings a classical air, offering the comfort of familiarity rather than the thrill of discovery. [13 Aug 1992]"
tt0105695,"Though the movie is riddled with memorable scenes of violence, its pace is slow -- too slow. It has an epic sprawl, but it's not an epic. It's more like a bloated fairy tale. [7 Aug 1992]"
tt0105695,"If Eastwood had any emotional depth as an actor, the character's anguish might come through."
tt0105695,"At the last, we're left with a film that tries to doll up a conventional genre with hints of depth, hoping to disguise the cross-dressing by putting it in the shape of an epic. Murnau, Mizoguchi, Ford, even you authors of the Book of Genesis, rest easy. [12 Oct 1992]"
tt6791350,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 mixes Gunn's usual wacky action and laugh-out-loud humor with a grounded, emotional story to create something special."
tt6791350,"For all the emotional resonance and action-packed blockbuster mayhem in Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, it’s still got a lot of impish nonsense, jarring tonal shifts, and enough morbidity and outright gore that it’s now abundantly clear that the PG-13 rating doesn’t mean anything more. This is a movie that will probably traumatize some kids and maybe a few adults."
tt6791350,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 isn’t just the ideal sendoff for this group, it’s the best MCU film in years, and a reminder of how much fun and moving the Marvel Cinematic Universe can actually be after film-after-film of recent disappointments. The Guardians of the Galaxy were the best corner of the MCU, and Gunn has created the perfect goodbye to this gang of misfits."
tt6791350,"The Guardians of the Galaxy deliver their swan song in Vol. 3 and it’s a rockin’ good time. Through Rocket’s tragic origin story we’re given a new appreciation for this whole family of lovable malcontents. And even though the plot has a bit too much going on, some of the humor feels stale, and Adam Warlock was woefully underused, the cast’s incredible chemistry and James Gunn’s soulful style remain unlike anything else in the MCU, and this movie sends them out on an emotional and action-packed high note."
tt6791350,"A space adventure that is alternately funny and upsetting, featuring a literal menagerie of the strange and unconventional."
tt6791350,"Watching his Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate need with personal blockbuster filmmaking. Mostly."
tt6791350,"These pictures have grown less cute, less charming and less fun with each passing installment, and this one just drags as it meanders towards its over-hyped lump-in-throat finale."
tt6791350,The film undermines its initial sense of intimacy and momentum with a stop-and-start story structure that by and large exists to make as much room as possible for its characters’ banter.
tt6791350,"And that, perhaps, is the real fatal flaw of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3."" Gunn's first two movies felt different. They stood out from the pack and had their own unique personality. But ""Vol. 3"" feels like more of the same. I'm not suggesting Gunn and company are phoning it in this time around, but it certainly feels like the magic has faded. Whatever alchemy the filmmaker worked to make the first two ""Guardians"" movies memorable has evaporated into the ether."
tt6791350,"It’s not a disaster, and it doesn’t lack for ambition. But it’s wildly uneven and kind of blah, if that can be said of a movie with nonstop, often incoherent action, self-aware needle drops and not nearly enough smart-aleck quips from a cast we’ve seen deliver plenty of them in the past."
tt1130884,"DiCaprio, in his most haunting and emotionally complex performance yet, is the vessel Scorsese uses to lead us through the film’s laby­rinth."
tt1130884,"Even when it's clear Scorsese has decided to employ fakery and allow it to be obvious, it's done with elegance and beauty."
tt1130884,"It's not a great movie so much as it is great moviemaking. It's basically a potboiler genre film, a B-movie with big talent attached."
tt1130884,It's a pleasure to experience Scorsese as a circus master. One just hopes he doesn't continue in this vein.
tt1130884,"Since more attention has gone into filigreeing details into each scene than worrying about the way they'll fit together, the rattletrap engages you moment-to-moment, even as the overall pacing stops and lurches alarmingly."
tt1130884,Shutter Island is a bear hug to cinema while it’s also an occasionally tart valentine to genre.
tt1130884,"This gruesome thriller set in a fogbound insane asylum is incomprehensible and fatally flawed, but having said all of that, I will also say this: It never seems anything less than the work of a skillful film buff. Mr. Scorsese may be a smart aleck, but he’s a professional smart aleck."
tt1130884,"It’s not bad, but as Scorsese, America’s greatest living filmmaker and film history buff should know, even Hitchcock came up short on occasion."
tt1130884,Shutter Island is slumming: minor but enjoyably nuts.
tt1130884,"The ending is powerful..., but Shutter Island is a long slog."
tt0167404,"Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan lets the tension rise slowly, leads you everywhere you don't expect, doesn't rip you off and totally freaks you out -- all without stale effects or gore."
tt0167404,Chalk this film up as an unusually intelligent thriller about that which scares us the most: accepting our accidents of fate.
tt0167404,"It's far more loquacious and cerebral than your average run-of-the-mill thriller, but boy, when the relatively infrequent scares do come, they will pull you out of your seat and raise the hair on your arms."
tt0167404,Ultimately affecting mix 'n' match weeper.
tt0167404,Sometimes verges on silliness.
tt0167404,"Ultimately, it has less in common with ""Blair Witch"" than with such quivering lumps of sentiment as ""Ghost"" and Field of Dreams."""
tt0167404,"Borderline dull to sit through, The Sixth Sense is actually rather interesting to think about afterward because of the revelation of its ending."
tt0167404,"Complain all you want about Willis's posturing and the rabbit-in-the-hat ending (predicated as it is on a vast plothole), the film is still a rarity, a studio horror movie focused on a child's traumatic stress."
tt0167404,"At least tries to disturb us, rather than shock us or gross us out, and that is admirable. But it doesn't pull it off, and the movie is indicative of the trouble Hollywood has these days making that most frightening kind of movie -- the kind that lets the audience frighten itself."
tt0167404,"Because the movie never fully engages us, it never quite manages to allay our queasiness about watching the boy's distress."
tt0107290,"As a flight of fantasy, Jurassic Park lacks the emotional unity of Spielberg's classics (""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters,"" ""E.T.""), yet it has enough of his innocent, playful virtuosity to send you out of the theater grinning with delight."
tt0107290,"For dinosaurs to rule the earth again, the monsters needed majesty as well as menace. And Spielberg got it all right. [14 June 1993, p.69]"
tt0107290,"The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values."
tt0107290,"There's only one kind of movie that Spielberg has truly mastered: the kind that looks like a wide-screen video game complete with loony plot twists and mind-bending special effects. And that's Jurassic Park down to its bones. [11 June 1993, Arts, p.12]"
tt0107290,"It becomes less crisp on screen than it was on the page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away. [11 June 1993, p.C1]"
tt0107290,"Spielberg's scary and horrific thriller may be one-dimensional and even clunky in story and characterization, but definitely delivers where it counts, in excitement, suspense and the stupendous realization of giant reptiles."
tt0107290,"The results make poor old King Kong look like something from a Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Such is progress. [12 July 1993, p.26]"
tt0107290,"All the imagination and effort (including 18 months of pre-production) that went into making the dinosaurs state-of-the-art exciting apparently left no time to make the people similarly believable or involving. In fact, when the big guys leave the screen, you'll be tempted to leave the theater with them. [11 June 1993, Calendar, p.F-1]"
tt0107290,"There's more soul to be found in any Kong close-up than in this film's overplayed reactions, which are used to instruct us what we should be feeling at any given moment. This is never boring, but I can't recall another Spielberg film that left me with a more hollow feeling."
tt0107290,"Perfectly passable kiddie escapism. It has a thrill or two, and a chill or three, but it has no poetry, little sense of wonder, no resonant subtext (Jungian or otherwise), no art... When it's over, it's gone. Extinct."
tt0268978,"The result is mainstream moviemaking at its highest, most satisfying level."
tt0268978,"Inspiring and largely unsentimental, this is as much a love story as a tale of courage."
tt0268978,"Though the role might seem a real stretch for an actor who just won an Oscar for his Charlton Heston turn as Maximus in ""Gladiator,"" he and the movie ace the test."
tt0268978,"The film makes more apparent than ever that Howard is quite underrated as a filmmaker, possibly because he's been hidden in full view in the mainstream for so long."
tt0268978,Crowe sometimes summons up one of the most powerful depictions of mental illness I have ever seen with barely an eyelid flicker separating manifestations of sickness from utterly sane displays of creative concentration.
tt0268978,"As Nash gets closer to Crowe's own age (and level of dissipation), the performance settles down and becomes first credible and then overwhelming. This is a stupendous piece of acting."
tt0268978,What began as a bold and thrilling story descends into Hollywood clich&#233;. But Crowe and Connelly's work rises above the mush. They make A Beautiful Mind go.
tt0268978,"Howard, and the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, have used the book as nothing more than their jumping-off point for an erratic work of fiction that's part mystery thriller and part Hollywood schmaltz."
tt0268978,"Instead of an originally conceived movie that reflects Nash's troubled but brilliant mind, we have one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies -- the kind that seem exclusively designed for Best Picture nominations."
tt0268978,"While it's a splendidly acted film, A Beautiful Mind is also a wasted opportunity."
tt0055630,"[Kurosawa] was deliberately combining the samurai story with the Western, so that the wind-swept main street could be in any frontier town, the samurai (Toshiro Mifune) could be a gunslinger, and the local characters could have been lifted from John Ford's gallery of supporting actors."
tt0055630,"Less visceral than the battle scene in Seven Samurai, this is more of a free-for-all, with brute force leaving no room for skill."
tt0055630,"Yojimbo does not cause viewers to ponder deep issues in the way Rashomon does, nor does it possess the epic grandness of The Seven Samurai, yet it must still be considered in the top tier of Kurosawa's films. Stylish, compelling, and involving, it became as much a blueprint for future productions as it is an homage to past ones."
tt0055630,"Something of a textbook example of the perfect crowd-pleaser, Kurosawa’s tale is sociopolitical wish fulfillment via archetypal samurai drama, albeit with a twist or three."
tt0055630,"One of the great samurai pictures, its darkly brilliant premise--the cynical mercenary/master swordsman or yojimbo (bodyguard) who walks into a town feud and plays both evil sides against each other--has been copied frequently, most notably in the Sergio Leone-Clint Eastwood A Fistful of Dollars. But Kurosawa's treatment remains the most savage, thrilling, smart and hideously funny. [26 Jan 2007, p.C2]"
tt0055630,"Though this lacks the epic stature of Seven Samurai, Kurosawa here again shows his mastery of the medium."
tt0055630,"You won't find a more bone-jarring set of fight scenes than the ones on display here, while Mifune's blood-letting drifter offers a masterclass in justice-dispensing cool."
tt0055630,"With Mifune's tongue-in-cheek performance and the wildly stylized battle scenes featuring mallet and pistol-wielding samurai, YOJIMBO may just be the first post-modern samurai film."
tt0055630,"Far from being just another vehicle for Mifune, this belongs in that select group of films noirs which are also comedies."
tt0055630,"Kurosawa's imagery is alway exciting. [25 Oct 1962, p.16]"
tt0040897,"The movie has never really been about gold but about character, and Bogart fearlessly makes Fred C. Dobbs into a pathetic, frightened, selfish man -- so sick we would be tempted to pity him, if he were not so undeserving of pity."
tt0040897,"Like ""The Searchers"", this is so brilliant that the only real effect of the other versions is to make you want to watch the original again."
tt0040897,"Mr. Huston has shaped a searching drama of the collision of civilization's vicious greeds with the instinct for self-preservation in an environment where all the barriers are down. And, by charting the moods of his prospectors after they have hit a vein of gold, he has done a superb illumination of basic characteristics in men. One might almost reckon that he has filmed an intentional comment here upon the irony of avarice in individuals and in nations today...But don't let this note of intelligence distract your attention from the fact that Mr. Huston is putting it over in a most vivid and exciting action display."
tt0040897,A distinguished work that will take its place in the repertory of Hollywood's great and enduring achievements.
tt0040897,"Arguably John Huston's greatest film, this powerful study of masculinity under pressure retains its power."
tt0040897,"One of the best things Hollywood has done since it learned to talk; and the movie can take a place, without blushing, among the best ever made."
tt0040897,John Huston was rarely in better form than he was directing this 1948 study of gold fever and worse obsessions among an unlikely trio of prospectors... Bogart is outstanding as the pathetic bully Fred C. Dobbs.
tt0040897,"One of the strongest of all American movies...The picture is emotionally memorable, though - it has a powerful cumulative effect; when it's over you know you've seen something."
tt0040897,"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is as enduring a classic as has ever come out of Hollywood, and arguably among the greatest, but the film is admittedly not without its share of rough spots."
tt0040897,"Outrageously Oscar-seeking performances like actor Huston's, coupled with director Huston's comparative conviction with action sequences, work against any yearning for significance. There's a quite enjoyable yarn buried under the hollow laughter."
tt0071853,"What we have here is an historical document of inestimable value, describing in no uncertain terms the terrible and beautiful times before AIDS."
tt0071853,It's still the Holy Grail of crazy comedy.
tt0071853,Nobody ever placed brilliance in the service of silliness quite the way the Python gang did. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is stuffed with both.
tt0071853,A medieval-on-your-ass laff-riot.
tt0071853,"The material is superb, Neil Innes’ music is tremendous and Gilliam’s animations are timelessly brilliant."
tt0071853,"An incredibly silly film of great humor, brilliant design and epic insanity."
tt0071853,"Has a sense of humor that is intellectual, even academic, at heart."
tt0071853,"Silly, sophomoric, and slapped together, but would you want it any other way?"
tt0071853,Still stands as a gloriously silly and twisted send-up.
tt0071853,"Basically an excuse for set pieces, some amusing, others overdone."
tt0477348,"Joel and Ethan Coen's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel is an indisputably great movie, at this point the year's very best."
tt0477348,"A scorching blast of tense genre filmmaking shot through with rich veins of melancholy, down-home philosophy and dark, dark humor, No Country for Old Men reps a superior match of source material and filmmaking talent."
tt0477348,"The most measured, classical film of their (Coen Brothers) 23-year career, and maybe the best."
tt0477348,"The breath of cinematic life, though, the sensibility, the energy, belong to Joel and Ethan Coen, and this is their stirring success."
tt0477348,It’s a near masterpiece.
tt0477348,"It's the most ambitious and impressive Coen film in at least a decade, featuring the flat, sun-blasted landscapes of west Texas -- spectacularly shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins -- and an eerily memorable performance by Javier Bardem, in a Ringo Starr haircut."
tt0477348,"It’s mostly an off-kilter road trip that accomplishes what the Coens do best - seamlessly merging drama, violence, and quirky humor into a whole."
tt0477348,"As pure craftsmanship, No Country for Old Men is as good as we’ve ever gotten from Joel and Ethan Coen. Only “Fargo” is more satisfying (it’s also a comedy, which this one isn’t)."
tt0477348,"The Coens' typically superior filmmaking sustains the electrifying mood for most of the picture, but they are undone by being too faithful to the source novel by Cormac McCarthy."
tt0477348,"Beyond question a return to the dark, simmering days of their best work, in “Blood Simple” and “Miller’s Crossing.”"
tt0266697,"It remains to be seen whether Kill Bill is merely a skilled slice of juvenilia or a pastiche with real emotional and thematic underpinnings, but based on Tarantino's storytelling command in the first half, it's worth giving him the benefit of the doubt."
tt0266697,"A hyper-violent, hyper-gory, kung-fu grindhouse flick. And there&#8217;s nothing at all wrong with that."
tt0266697,"Is Kill Bill a homage to great Asian action movies? Yes. Is Tarantino trying to outdo his cherished masters (on a budget that dwarfs their films)? Of course. Is there any other point of any of this? Let's see ""Vol. 2."""
tt0266697,"A strange, fun and densely textured work that gets better as it goes along."
tt0266697,"Brilliant, but shallow."
tt0266697,"Though it's a blast to watch, it becomes tiresome over the long haul--25 minutes of Thurman hacking her way through the crowd to get to a woman whose fate we're informed of early on. It's the most climactic anti-climax in recent film history, a no-d'uh coda awaiting the ending it really deserves but never gets. Not this year, anyway."
tt0266697,"An incomplete movie, artlessly cleft in the middle. Cinema interruptus."
tt0266697,"Fun and smart, but undeniably thin, the first installment of Tarantino's action epic is a fanboy fever dream. The clich&#233;s are out in maximum force, tempting any critic fool enough to go one-on-one with the master. (The prize: a Ph.D. in Tarantinology.)"
tt0266697,"When French New Wave directors like Truffaut and Godard paid tribute to Hollywood pulp, they poeticized it and gave it an infusion of feeling. Tarantino&#8217;s tributes are, for the most part, far less complicated: He&#8217;s a fan, and Kill Bill is his mash note."
tt0266697,"Kill Bill is what&#8217;s formally known as decadence and commonly known as crap...Coming out of this dazzling, whirling movie, I felt nothing--not anger, not dismay, not amusement. Nothing. [13 October 2003, p. 113]"
tt0057115,"The final act of The Great Escape is a masterfully sustained piece of action and tension as the various escapees struggle for freedom via train, bicycle, motorbike, row boat and hitchhiking. The Great Escape should always be seen. It reminds us of a history that is all too quickly forgotten."
tt0057115,"McQueen speeding across the German countryside and leaping over the first of two barbed-wire fences leading into Switzerland may be the film's most iconic and enduring image. Dubious or not, it's a triumph of sorts that a tale that ends in war crimes could have such a rousing conclusion."
tt0057115,"Expertly directed and written with an infectious undercurrent of wry humor, this classic WWII POW escape yarn features an all-star cast of hardened Allied prisoners who the Germans have thrown together in a special escape-proof camp."
tt0057115,"One of the all-time great action movies, The Great Escape also features an all-star international cast. The first half of the movie sets up all the various characters who have to drop their prickly differences and unite to outwit their German captors. Steve McQueen as the Cooler King is a genuine classic."
tt0057115,"With accurate casting, a swift screenplay, and authentic German settings, Producer-Director John Sturges has created classic cinema of action. There is no sermonizing, no soul probing, no sex. The Great Escape is simply great escapism."
tt0057115,"Producer-director John Sturges has fashioned a motion picture that entertains, captivates, thrills and stirs."
tt0057115,"The Great Escape is that rare war film that doesn’t fully indulge in assumed nationalism, save for the fact that everyone speaks English. Sturges never touches on the essential hollowness and cruel pageantry of war, but he does the next best thing by depicting an international effort where victory, no matter how short-lived, depends on the cooperation of myriad talents, rather than the gruff can-do attitude of an unbreakable chosen one."
tt0057115,"Way too flabby at 168 minutes, but once this 1963 feature gets going it's good, solid stuff, directed with an unusual lack of rhetoric by John Sturges."
tt0057115,"Uneven but entertaining World War II escape drama, which even when it first appeared seemed very old-fashioned. Worth seeing the last half hour, if nothing else, for one of the best stunt sequences in years: McQueen's motor-cycle bid for freedom."
tt0057115,"There are a few moments when Richard Attenborough as the chief engineer of the whole project demonstrates some impressive strength and poise. But for much longer than is artful or essential, The Great Escape grinds out its tormenting story without a peek beneath the surface of any man, without a real sense of human involvement. It's a strictly mechanical adventure with make-believe men."
tt0042876,"Today, nearly fifty years after it was made, Rashomon has lost none of its fascination or power. It's still a marvelous piece of cinema that asks unanswerable questions of great import."
tt0042876,"The wonder of Rashomon is that while the shadowplay of truth and memory is going on, we are absorbed by what we trust is an unfolding story."
tt0042876,"It was the film that introduced the world at large to master director Akira Kurosawa and his frequent, infinitely watchable star Toshiro Mifune."
tt0042876,"One of the most brilliantly constructed films of all time, RASHOMON is a monument to Akira Kurosawa's greatness, combining his well-known humanism with an experimental narrative style that has become a hallmark of film history."
tt0042876,"Every element in the film, from the dense thicket of forest branches to master cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa's deceptive framing and lighting design, is precisely calibrated to make the facts more difficult to discern."
tt0042876,"Kurosawa is always worth a look but this is a particular classic that has influenced so much to come, it's almost essential."
tt0042876,"Akira Kurosawa's 1950 masterwork is a chilling, utterly memorable dissection of the nature of human communication."
tt0042876,"Film is still an impressive piece of work, visually and rhythmically masterful."
tt0042876,The film is still one of the most glorious testaments to the frustrations and exhilarations of chasing an unvarnished truth.
tt0042876,"This level of mastery is timeless, and although the movie is overly deliberate at times, when it takes off, it really flies."
tt0084787,"The Thing is a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina-wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror, placing 12 men at an Antarctic station while a shapeshifter takes them over one by one."
tt0084787,"The menace of the dark polar night and the claustrophobic confines of the base are utilised to raise the fear, tension and paranoia to unbearable heights. This is a creature that doesn't just hide in the dark, but could be your friend, your colleague, or the girl beside you whose hand you are breaking in a terrified vice-like grip."
tt0084787,"The Thing has emerged as one of our most potent modern terrors, combining the icy-cold chill of suspicion and uncertainty with those magnificently imaginative effects blowouts."
tt0084787,"The Thing is paranoid, bleak, uncompromising, and thankfully devoid of a traditional Hollywood happy ending. Led by Russell, the ensemble cast is outstanding, but the real star of the film is Rob Bottin's imaginative creature effects."
tt0084787,"A paranoia-choked atmosphere is the primary reason why The Thing works as well as it does. The setup is standard stuff, establishing that the characters are isolated and can expect no help from the outside. The realization there could be an alien among them, and any one of them might not be human, is what launches The Thing into a spiral of escalating tension."
tt0084787,"With its fades to blinding white and its atmosphere of testosterone-fueled paranoia, Carpenter's remake hews more closely to the source material — John W. Campbell, Jr.'s 1938 novella ""Who Goes There?"" — than THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD and is a masterful exercise in claustrophobic suspense."
tt0084787,"The Thing is basically just a geek show, a gross-out movie in which teenagers can dare one another to watch the screen. There's nothing wrong with that; I like being scared and I was scared by many scenes in The Thing. But it seems clear that Carpenter made his choice early on to concentrate on the special effects and the technology and to allow the story and people to become secondary."
tt0084787,"If it’s the most vividly gruesome monster ever to stalk the screen that audiences crave, then The Thing is the thing. On all other levels, however, John Carpenter’s remake of Howard Hawks’ 1951 sci-fi classic comes as a letdown."
tt0084787,The Thing is too phony looking to be disgusting. It qualifies only as instant junk.
tt0084787,"Carpenter's direction is slow, dark, and stately; he seems to be aiming for an enveloping, novelistic kind of effect, but all he gets is heaviness."
tt0266543,"You could trawl the seven seas and not net a funnier, more beautiful, and more original work of art and comedy than Finding Nemo."
tt0266543,"This time the dad is the hero of the story, although in most animation it is almost always the mother."
tt0266543,"Finding Nemo and its Pixar predecessors tap into the shared gene among the kids and adults that delights in imagination-engaging, eye-tickling and wit-filled storytelling. You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure."
tt0266543,"The humor bubbling through Finding Nemo is so fresh, sure of itself and devoid of the cutesy, saccharine condescension that drips through so many family comedies that you have to wonder what it is about the Pixar technology that inspires the creators to be so endlessly inventive."
tt0266543,"An undersea treasure all the same, and a prodigy of visual energy."
tt0266543,Pixar is so good at what it does that every other kiddie-entertainment purveyor -- including parent company Disney -- flounders in comparison.
tt0266543,"Though the Disney logo is on this movie, there is -- possibly excepting little Nemo himself -- not a single cloying, sentimental Disneyesque creature in it. There is, instead, wit and flair in concept and writing, the trademark of the Pixar people who drove the project."
tt0266543,"The whole thing is absolutely beautiful to look at, even when it has a bad case of the cutes."
tt0266543,"Though not as great as ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" Pixar movies that are the gold standard for family movies, Finding Nemo is visually entrancing."
tt0266543,"Finding Nemo is, as it happens, the most dangerously sugared of the Pixar productions to date--how could any father-finding-son saga be otherwise?--but the threat is now one of oversophistication. [9 June 2003, p. 108]"
tt10872600,"Separated from the most exciting/controversial/unexpected moments in play, and without the element of surprise, does No Way Home hold up as a good story well told? The answer is yes to a degree…but it could have gone further."
tt10872600,Spider-Man: No Way Home bounces from hilarious to hurt with ease as both the darkest and funniest MCU Spider-Man entry to date.
tt10872600,"Briskly balancing a dizzying assortment of parts, Marvel's latest (by way of Sony) looks destined to do what only a spider can -- namely, lure vast numbers of fans into its web."
tt10872600,"No Way Home is Spider-Man’s most intriguing & fun story yet. Though the multiverse looms large, the film's thoughtful in its focus on Peter's journey."
tt10872600,The most superheroic feat on display might be the film’s ability to keep human-sized emotions and relationships front and center even as the very fabric of time and space twists itself into knots.
tt10872600,"But that’s Spider-Man in a nutshell. He’s the guy who perpetually breaks stuff, then has to patch it all back together. (Good thing he’s got those webs.) No Way Home, with its use of the old characters from previous Spider-Man movies, really gets that idea. Power and responsibility are important. Seeing something through after you mess it up? That’s the mark of a genuine hero."
tt10872600,"This is the least fun of the Watts/Holland pictures by a wide margin (intentionally so, to some extent), but it’s a hell of a lot better than the last Spidey threequel, Sam Raimi’s overstuffed and ill-conceived Spider-Man 3."
tt10872600,"The road to the closing moments of “No Way Home” — both warm-hearted and heartbreaking — might have hit a few bumps, but the darkness is worth it. After all, when was the last time the third film in a franchise got audiences truly thrilled for what comes next?"
tt10872600,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is maximalist, chock full of familiar characters and callbacks, and sometimes all that greatest-hits reminiscing is diverting and and entertaining. But it’s also not very necessary, making for a very regressive, fan-service-y ‘Spider-Man’ legacy-sequel that’s overly nostalgic for its heydays."
tt10872600,"It’s flawed for sure but still moves with more deftness than most (arriving after Eternals is a blessing for any Marvel film) and there’s an ending that suggests an awareness of its roots (post-credits scene aside), hinting at a promising way forward rather than back. Consider the curse of sorts sort of broken."
tt0080678,"Hurt is brilliant as Merrick, projecting in his anguished eyes and mournful body language a humanity past the makeup that embodies so convincingly the pain of Merrick, the original elephant man, whose rare disease was exploited by the people running a Victorian freak show."
tt0080678,"This is a tale of redemption and transcendence, of the hunchback of London Hospital, of the noble phantom who want to go to the opera, of Beauty and the Beast. In Treves' account, though, the Beast was a Beauty. In Lynch's hands, so is this film."
tt0080678,"A marvelous movie, shot in stunning black-and-white by Freddie Francis."
tt0080678,"Hurt gives a tour de force performance, masterfully conveying emotions while unable to use his face or even much of his voice."
tt0080678,"Hopkins is splendid in a subtly nuanced portrayal of a man torn between humanitarianism and qualms that his motives in introducing the Elephant Man to society are no better than those of the brutish carny. The center-piece of the film, however, is the virtuoso performance by the almost unrecognizable John Hurt."
tt0080678,"A very pleasurable surprise. Lighted by Freddie Francis, this film is perhaps the most beautiful example of black-and-white cinematography in about 15 years."
tt0080678,Lynch’s powerful depiction of Merrick (played by John Hurt) moves a viewer from revulsion and fear to empathy and tenderness.
tt0080678,"If you thought the sweetness of The Straight Story was unprecedented in Lynchs work, look again at this earlier true-life tale of odd, everyday heroism."
tt0080678,"I kept asking myself what the film was really trying to say about the human condition as reflected by John Merrick, and I kept drawing blanks. The film's philosophy is this shallow: (1)Wow, the Elephant Man sure looked hideous, and (2)gosh, isn't it wonderful how he kept on in spite of everything?"
tt0080678,"Despite the rich associations, the film finally makes little more of its central figure, a hideously deformed young man, than an object of pity."
tt0071315,"A nearly flawless example of movie composition, with close examination revealing how carefully it was put together. For those who take a less studious and more visceral approach to movie viewing, it's also worth noting that Chinatown is a superior thriller - one that will keep viewers involved and ""in the moment"" until the final, mournful scene has come to a conclusion."
tt0071315,"[Nicholson's] performance is key in keeping Chinatown from becoming just a genre crime picture--that, and a Robert Towne screenplay that evokes an older Los Angeles, a small city in a large desert."
tt0071315,"A wonderfully brooding, suspenseful revisitation of the land of film noir, Chinatown is not only one of the greatest detective films, but one of the most perfectly constructed of all films."
tt0071315,But it's Polanski who pries the genre open until it goes metaphysical.
tt0071315,An outstanding picture.
tt0071315,"But the greatness of Chinatown, unappreciated by my adolescent self, lies not in its cynical view of the California dream (that's too easy) but in its fatalistic, even tragic conception of America and indeed of human nature."
tt0071315,"A bit abstract, though gorgeously shot (by John Alonzo) and cleverly plotted (by Robert Towne), Polanski's film suggests that the rules of the game are written in some strange, untranslatable language, and that everyone's an alien and, ultimately, a victim."
tt0071315,"In 1974 a director, a screenwriter, and a producer (Robert Evans, who for once deserves a few of the plaudits he's apportioned himself) could decide to beat a genre senseless and then dump it in the wilds of Greek tragedy. [Review of August 8, 2003 re-release]"
tt0071315,"Mr. Polanski and Mr. Towne attempted nothing so witty and entertaining, being content instead to make a competently stylish, more or less thirites-ish movie that continually made me wish I were back seeing ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep."" Others may not be as finicky. [21 June 1974]"
tt0071315,"As much as I admire the work of both (Roman) Polanski and (Jack) Nicholson, I found Chinatown tedious from beginning to just before the end. [15 July 1974]"
tt0434409,"It's a terrific movie. I love the look and the verve of the thing, the confidence of its epic design, its smart use of half a dozen noted British thesps, lending weight and wit to the supporting roles."
tt0434409,The explosive V for Vendetta is powered by ideas that are not computer-generated. It's something rare in Teflon Hollywood: a movie that sticks with you.
tt0434409,"V for Vendetta represents 2006's first memorable motion picture - a visually sumptuous concoction that combines political allegory, bloody action, and a few stunning cinematic moments into a solid piece of entertainment."
tt0434409,"Setting out more to challenge us with its ideas than make us whoop at the action, Vendetta can be clumsy, but there are enough impressive flourishes to make up for its stumblings."
tt0434409,"Mostly, it's content to remain a compelling, visually striking political mystery with some big ideas woven into it--subversive notions about integrity, liberty, and political change."
tt0434409,"Viewers expecting a thrill ride might be disappointed. V engages in a couple of satisfying crime-fighting set pieces, but the story is more occupied with mystery and intrigue. Happily, it almost is entirely free of the hollow pomposity that marred the Wachowskis' last two ""Matrix"" films."
tt0434409,"Suffers from many of same problems as last two installments of producers Andy and Larry Wachowski's ""Matrix"" franchise: indigestible dialogue, pacing difficulties and too much pseudo-philosophical info."
tt0434409,"Absorbing even in its incoherence,V for Vendetta manages to make an old popular mythology new. Impossible not to break into a grin: It's the thought that counts."
tt0434409,"The movie plays like a clumsy assault on post-9/11 paranoia. It references ""America's war,"" uses imagery direct from Abu Ghraib and contains dialogue likely to offend anyone who's not, say, a suicide bomber."
tt0434409,"The quarter-century-old disgruntled fantasies of two English comic-book artists, amplified by a powerful movie company, and ambushed by history, wind up yielding a disastrous muddle."
tt0081398,The performances are riveting and the visuals are stunning. The boxing sequences are brutally realistic - there are no crappy Rocky theatrics here - and the humanity oozes out of every scene.
tt0081398,"The most painful and heartrending portrait of jealousy in the cinema--an ""Othello'' for our times."
tt0081398,"Filmed in black-and-white and shockingly well acted by De Niro, Raging Bull suggests that if you are looking for the source of evil in the world, you don't have to look any further than yourself. It's inside you or it isn't. And it comes out or it doesn't. [19 Dec 1980]"
tt0081398,"Another harsh character study, with poignant echoes of ""Taxi Driver."""
tt0081398,One of the bloodiest and most beautiful reflections on atonement in the Scorsese canon... It is still one of cinema's most breathtaking films.
tt0081398,"The entire film is played at such high pitch it may well exhaust audiences that don't come prepared. And, at the heart of the film, there is the mystery of Jake himself, but that is what separates Raging Bull from all other fight movies, in fact, from most movies about anything. Raging Bull is an achievement."
tt0081398,"Takes a cold, unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring."
tt0081398,"A fiercely poetic study of violence. Stunningly shot in black-and-white. [14 Dec 1989, p.23]"
tt0081398,The intensity of the film verges on the intolerable.
tt0081398,"As LaMotta, Robert De Niro gives a blank, soulless performance; there's so little of depth or urgency coming from him that he's impossible to despise, or forgive, in any but the most superficial way."
tt0031381,"A towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well."
tt0031381,"Well, even if it is essentially four hours about a selfish, silly cow, it's impeccably well made, and should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in romance or movies."
tt0031381,"One of the truly great films, destined for record-breaking box office business everywhere. The lavishness of its production, the consummate care and skill which went into its making, the assemblage of its fine cast and expert technical staff combine in presenting a theatrical attraction completely justifying the princely investment of $3,900,000."
tt0031381,"Some elements seem grotesquely dated, but this restoration of the 1939 classic finds the film as powerful and mad as ever."
tt0031381,To see Gone With the Wind on a big screen again is to weep for the fearlessness with which Hollywood once believed the sublime was possible.
tt0031381,The most striking effect of the Technicolor process is its subtlety. The viewer is aware of the gradations of flesh tones in Leigh's face and can see the color rise in her cheeks. The exact color of her eyes is a source of fascination (they are gray-blue with flashes of green).
tt0031381,"Whatever it was not, Gone With the Wind was a first-rate piece of Americana, and Americans in the mass knew what they wanted before the critics had got through telling them they should not want it."
tt0031381,"Is it the greatest motion picture ever made? Probably not, although it is the greatest motion mural we have seen and the most ambitious film-making venture in Hollywood's spectacular history."
tt0031381,"Overblown and melodramatic, it somehow achieves more than the schmaltz of its parts, thanks to a spirited modern heroine, the spoilt Scarlett O'Hara, and its refusal to give us the neat conclusions you'd expect from a 19th-century saga of ""cottonfields and cavaliers."""
tt0031381,"Although this epic romantic melodrama is undoubtedly one of the most popular and beloved motion pictures ever to grace the silver screen, it is also arguably the most overrated. Gone with the Wind is a very good movie, perhaps bordering on being great, but its subject matter and running time (which is easily 60 minutes too long) argue against its status as a masterpiece."
tt0046912,The thrills come in following a succession of dawnings in people's minds.But Mr. Hitchcock has presented this mental material on the screen with remarkable visual definition of developing intrigue and mood.
tt0046912,"If the things here are homelier and less loved than, say, Marnie's neon yellow purse or Cary Grant's glowing glass of milk, and the film itself no one's idea of major Hitch, it remains a fascinating investigation of a stillborn process from one of cinema's most dedicated inquisitors of structure."
tt0046912,"The result is a rather stagey film whose back projections look quaint, with 3D apparently used to foreground items of furniture, such as table-lamps, giving rise to some eccentric camera-angles. But the set-up is ingenious and the ""kill"" scene genuinely thrilling. [2013 3D Release]"
tt0046912,"Dial M is starred with fine scenes and good performances. Though played as contemporary melodrama, it somehow manages to reflect the gaslight magic of turn-of-the-century London."
tt0046912,"Its trick is to generate considerable suspense while withholding nothing from the audience. Its pleasures are not profound ones, but there’s enough dimensionality up on the screen to compensate. [2013 3D Release]"
tt0046912,"What tends to make even lesser Hitchcock films shine is his innate gift for directing performers, and this accounts for many of the pleasures of this ditty."
tt0046912,"Lower case Hitch, but diverting and sleek, with the climax early on. [review of original release]"
tt0046912,"The screenplay tends to constrain rather than liberate Hitchcock's thematic thrust, but there is much of technical value in his geometric survey of the scene and the elaborate strategies employed to transfer audience sympathy among the four main characters."
tt0046912,Despite Hitchcock's own reservations this is definitely worth a look. Interesting to his aficionados and darkly funny and depressing in turns.
tt0046912,"There are a number of basic weaknesses in the setup that keep the picture from being a good suspense show for any but the most gullible. Via the performances and several suspense tricks expected of Hitchcock, the weaknesses are glossed over but not enough to rate the film a cinch winner."
tt0120735,"A dynamite bundle from British writer-director Guy Ritchie. Even when the accents are as indecipherable as the plot, Ritchie keeps the action percolating and the humor on high."
tt0120735,"Lock is filled with great writing, great acting, colorful characters, and a tight story. I actually like this film more than ""Pulp Fiction""."
tt0120735,"Ritchie's showmanship--half macho braggadocio, half emotion-tinged bravura--slaps and tickles the viewer into submission. He takes a group of not-so-goodfellas, whose idea of fun is setting farts afire, and, against all odds, makes them lively and engaging."
tt0120735,"Ritchie appears to have been paying attention to what made ""Reservoir Dogs"" (a huge hit in the UK) work, rather than coming away convinced that the formula for success begins and ends with pop-culture allusions and scarcely digested ""homages"" to classic crime films."
tt0120735,"If the dialect is hard to comprehend, that soon becomes part of the joke. It's unlikely that even the British audiences who made Lock, Stock a big hit got it all."
tt0120735,"Plenty of fun, less for its many plot twists than for its large and varied assortment of vibrant characters. [12 Mar 1999]"
tt0120735,"Though Ritchie&#146;s screenplay scores a 10 for sheer complexity and cleverness, it rates much lower down the scale for comprehensibility and audience involvement."
tt0120735,"The film's lures, while undeniable, are synthetic, and we never do learn what fuels all the greed besides pints of beer."
tt0120735,"A half-funny, half-ugly comedy about underworld ineptitude. [5 Mar 1999]"
tt0120735,"The best one can say is that it's a smart cartoon, and a fairly exhausting viewing experience."
tt2096673,"Co-directors Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen have told a very, very small-scale story when you look at what happens in the actual physical world. But in doing so, they've done something very powerful, because they have paid full respect to just how turbulent and important the inner life of a child can be."
tt2096673,"In execution, Pixar’s 15th feature proves to be the greatest idea the toon studio has ever had: a stunningly original concept that will not only delight and entertain the company’s massive worldwide audience, but also promises to forever change the way people think about the way people think, delivering creative fireworks grounded by a wonderfully relatable family story."
tt2096673,"This is a humane and heart-wrenchingly beautiful film from Docter; even measured alongside Pixar’s numerous great pictures, it stands out as one of the studio’s very best."
tt2096673,"It’s an audacious concept, and Docter’s imagination, along with those of his numerous collaborators, is adventurous and genially daft enough to put it over."
tt2096673,"Inside Out is not just fun and breezy, it's also truly weird and wicked smart in its thoroughly heartfelt conclusions."
tt2096673,"It hasn’t anything as genuinely emotionally devastating as Up, or the subtlety and inspired subversion of Monsters Inc. and the Toy Stories which it certainly resembles at various stages. But it is certainly a terrifically likeable, ebullient and seductive piece of entertainment, taken at full-throttle."
tt2096673,With most of the story of Inside Out playing out inside Riley’s mind – the child’s eyes providing the emotion-themed characters’ view of the outside world – the film offers ample scope for the creativity of the filmmaking team.
tt2096673,"All of this is achieved with the signature levels of emotional intelligence that Pixar are renowned for. The level of detail with which they have created this world is staggering, with each aspect of the psyche carefully thought out."
tt2096673,"At times, you ache to put the brakes on the chaos, but still Pixar manages to do with all this what they do best, turning the everyday rough and smooth of childhood experience into a thoughtful, inventive adventure, full of totally appropriate lurid and strange imagery."
tt2096673,"Both wonderfully complex and weirdly reductive at the same time—a formula, though, that seems as sound an embodiment of the human brain as any other."
tt0347149,"Though it's difficult to work out what's going on, it's never boring."
tt0347149,"An organic, childlike wonder, fabulously unpredictable and seethingly inventive."
tt0347149,You run across animation this ingenious about as often as a moving castle comes your way.
tt0347149,"The worldview, the sense of childlike fun shaded with adult melancholy, and the joyful, serene attention to visual oddity and wordless beauty could only be made in Japan. And, specifically, made by Hayao Miyazaki."
tt0347149,"The perfect e-ticket for a flight of fancy into a world far more gorgeous than our own. The film doesn't halve itself to appeal to two generations. At its best, it turns all moviegoers into innocent kids, slack-jawed with wonder."
tt0347149,Another soulful gem from the peerless Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki.
tt0347149,"Sophie, in both her incarnations, joins an impressive sisterhood of Miyazaki heroines, whose version of girl power presents a potent alternative to the mini-machismo that dominates American juvenile entertainment. Not that children are the only viewers likely to be haunted and beguiled by Howl's Moving Castle - all that is needed are open eyes and an open heart."
tt0347149,The tireless volley of ideas and inventions make this a delight that should connect with kids and adults in both dubbed and original-language versions.
tt0347149,Miyazaki's animated adaptation of Jones' book is a charming and thoroughly absorbing treat.
tt0347149,"It is almost inevitable that Miyazaki, often compared to C.S. Lewis and J.K. Rowling, should have found in Diana Wynne Jones a kindred spirit."
tt1305806,It's powerfully and richly imagined: a genre-busting movie that successfully combines the utmost in romanticism with the utmost in realism.
tt1305806,Campanella has laced his story with twists and turns worthy of Hitchcock and the framing device of the novel (which forces the protagonist to sort out the whole thing through writing) is ingenious.
tt1305806,"A deeply rewarding throwback to the unself-conscious days when cinema still strove to be magical, The Secrets in their Eyes is simply mesmerizing."
tt1305806,A riveting Argentine thriller spiked with witty dialogue and poignant love stories.
tt1305806,"Although it is structured like a thriller, and its plot dominated by Benjamin's detective work, The Secret in Their Eyes is really a cautionary tale about the consequences of a life of too much apprehension and propriety."
tt1305806,"The performances are tender, the script elegant, the cinematography (especially during a virtuoso chase scene in a soccer stadium) artful."
tt1305806,"The film sprawls across two decades and 127 minutes, but there isn't a memorable image in it."
tt1305806,"About as deep as a kiddie pool, which isn't to say it's an unpleasant frolic."
tt1305806,"The secret here is that the movie is rather tasteless. It has the high, slightly nauseating stink of perfume on garbage."
tt1305806,"Campanella, who overconfidently takes his time, outfits the film with ludicrous interrogation scenes, a drunken colleague who provides comic relief and redemptive tragedy, and a climactic flood of memories that plays like a trailer."
tt5027774,"Those familiar with McDonagh’s work will be unsurprised to learn that Three Billboards is a bold and showboating affair, robustly drawn and richly written; a violent carnival of small-town American life. Yet it has a big, beating heart, even a rough-edged compassion for its brawling inhabitants."
tt5027774,"It all makes for soaringly satisfying viewing, yet the satisfaction comes from blistering performances and virtuosic screenwriting, and absolutely nothing else."
tt5027774,"Not only is Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri the director’s most accomplished film yet, it’s also his most compassionate."
tt5027774,"What immediately comes to the forefront is that McDonagh has choreographed an almost impossible feat of a brutally dark comedy that, thanks to both Rockwell and McDormand, elicits an emotional response you simply don’t see coming."
tt5027774,"While the film continues almost throughout to generate great whoops of shocking laughter, it's the notes of genuine sorrow, compassion and contrition that resonate."
tt5027774,"Landing closer to Coens country, Three Billboards is more of a slow-roasting tragicomedy about grief and culpability, with higher stakes, a lower gag count, and emphasis on the tragic. But McDonagh still lives for detours and digressions, for the opportunity to stall the plot and humorously slow play a conversation."
tt5027774,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a multi-layered piece with such swathes of great dialogue that it will no doubt reward - if not demand - multiple viewings. It's also another item of evidence pointing toward a filmmaker getting into his stride."
tt5027774,"It’s full of sharp dialogue and entertaining characters and fuelled by a wryly enlightened view of our world and how it can be at once cruel and caring. For a story built on such dark foundations, it’s weirdly reassuring. It’s also enormous fun."
tt5027774,"It’s far from a masterpiece, yet it holds you, it adds up, and it’s something to see."
tt5027774,"Anchored by a funny, foul-mouthed performance from McDormand, McDonagh’s daringly-structured dark comedy is rich and layered and often laugh-out-loud funny but trips over constant tonal shifts."
tt0117951,"It would be hard to imagine a movie about drugs, depravity, and all-around bad behavior more electrifying than Trainspotting."
tt0117951,Keeps you engaged in this story of a memorable anti-hero for our times.
tt0117951,"Heroin may be a downer, but Trainspotting definitely takes you up&#133;a series of roaring, provocative, outrageous highs. [26 July 1996, Friday, p.C]"
tt0117951,Irresistibly bleak appeal.
tt0117951,It's a disturbing film in the best sense.
tt0117951,"Ewan McGregor in a raw, funny, star-making performance."
tt0117951,A must-see.
tt0117951,"Artfully ambivalent, Danny Boyle's film, twists with a junkie's logic. It does not preach; it wallows in the pain and, more daringly, in the pleasure."
tt0117951,"It uses a colorful vocabulary, it contains a lot of energy, it elevates its miserable heroes to the status of icons (in their own eyes, that is)."
tt0117951,"Captures the way drug addiction gives structure and purpose to aimless lives, and evokes the breathtaking rapture of a fix. All this and a happy ending, too."
tt0050212,"The story in the jungle moves ahead neatly, economically, powerfully."
tt0050212,"Possibly Lean's most complicated movie, Kwai is a towering work."
tt0050212,"A gripping drama, expertly put together and handled with skill in all departments. Its potency stems only partly from the boxoffice draw of William Holden and, to a lesser degree, Alec Guinness. What elevates “Kwai” to the rank of an artistic and financial triumph for producer Sam Spiegel is the engrossing entertainment it purveys, including some scenes which will be listed as among the best of film memorabilia."
tt0050212,"Brilliant is the word, and no other, to describe the quality of skills that have gone into the making of this picture, from the writing of the script out of a novel by the Frenchman Pierre Boulle, to direction, performance, photographing, editing and application of a musical score."
tt0050212,"Whereas Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago feel more pictorial than cinematic, The Bridge on the River Kwai carefully builds its psychological tension until it erupts in a blinding flash of sulfur and flame."
tt0050212,"The post-World War II cinematic landscape is littered with big-budget movies about the conflict and the toll it took upon those who participated. Some of those pictures have become timeless classics and some are nearly forgotten. Few, if any, are as simultaneously thrilling, awe-inspiring, and tragic as The Bridge on the River Kwai"
tt0050212,"Brilliant performances are to be credited to Alec Guinness, as the British colonel, who insists on sticking to the rules of the Geneva Conference governing prisoners of war, and Sessue Hayakawa as the stubborn, cruel, proud Japanese officer."
tt0050212,"This intelligent and exciting WWII tale, masterfully helmed by Lean (at the start of his ""epic"" period), features a splendid performance from Guinness as Col. Nicholson, a British officer who has surrendered with his regiment to the Japanese in Burma in 1943."
tt0050212,"The Bridge on the River Kwai is that rare film about something as seemingly black-and-white as World War II that is colored entirely in shades of gray, and the better for it."
tt0050212,"For what it is, it ain't bad, though it serves mainly as an illustration of the ancient quandary of revisionist moviemakers: if all you do is systematically invert cliches, you simply end up creating new ones."
tt1392214,"The thriller that's exciting, cathartic, and powerfully disturbing. Prisoners is that type of movie. It's rooted in 40 years of Hollywood revenge films, yet it also breaks audacious new ground."
tt1392214,"The picture is often graphic and pulls no punches in its disturbing violence, but its unflinching nature gives it a memorable sear that won't soon be forgotten."
tt1392214,"Prisoners can at times be a hard film to watch, but thanks to all the talent involved, it’s even harder to shake off."
tt1392214,"Rarely a moment is ever wasted, a consequence ignored, and though the climax is a corker, the final shot is even better. Prisoners requires and rewards your attention in equal measure. Be ready."
tt1392214,"Before all else, Villneuve's grim chronicle of the fallout when two young girls vanish in a small town succeeds at crafting one powerfully suspenseful moment after another."
tt1392214,"In his first English language film, Quebeçois director Denis Villeneuve has produced a masterful thriller that is also an engrossing study of a smalltown America battered by recession, fear and the unrelenting elements."
tt1392214,"A spellbinding, sensationally effective thriller with a complex moral center."
tt1392214,"Possibly year's most immaculate-looking drivel, a prismatically shot whodunit abundant in red herrings, but lacking in moral contemplation."
tt1392214,"This is the rough cut of a good movie, and a splendid opportunity wasted."
tt1392214,"Flexing some of that Jean Valjean resolve, but with a payload of untrammelled, Wolverine-like rage behind it, Jackman comes closest to shouldering the movie, without ever seriously threatening to make it work."
tt0116282,"Rotates its story through satire, comedy, suspense and violence, until it emerges as one of the best films I've ever seen."
tt0116282,Uniquely fascinating.
tt0116282,Frances McDormand enjoys the comedic role of her career.
tt0116282,"In the darkly humorous Fargo, iconoclastic filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen manage the precarious balancing act of respecting genre conventions and simultaneously pushing them to an almost surrealistic extreme. Very funny stuff."
tt0116282,"The Coens haven't been this sharp, focused and fluid since their first film. This is ""Blood Simple's"" promise fulfilled."
tt0116282,"This mordant, macabre look at the American obsession with fast food, television and murder is icily funny."
tt0116282,"What mainly registers is the quiet desperation and simple pleasures of ordinary midwestern lives, the fatuous ways that people cover up their emotional and intellectual gaps, and the alternating pointlessness and cuteness of human existence. This may be a masterpiece of sorts, but it left me feeling rotten."
tt0116282,"It's easy to admire what the Coens are trying to do in Fargo, but more difficult to actually like the film."
tt0116282,"To the extent that the joke is on us, the audience, and the decadent taste we've acquired for flashy violence, it works; point taken."
tt0116282,All attitude and low aptitude.
tt1291584,"It hardly rewrites the rulebook, but Warrior is a powerful, moving and brilliant sports-pic-cum-family drama. Like ""The Fighter,"" but with kicking."
tt1291584,"It's a long movie that feels short: It grabs you in early scenes, intense though low-key before all hell breaks loose, then keeps you riveted to its mostly male characters."
tt1291584,"O'Connor gives the film a dark, moody look, which is the best choice for so many roiling emotions. This is not a traditional stand-up-and-cheer fight movie; the undercurrents are too strong and deep."
tt1291584,An improbably effective and affecting mix of raw emotions and exciting smackdowns.
tt1291584,"Though Warrior excels at the big stuff-fighting sequences and rousing crowds and victories that all but force audiences to stand up and cheer - the film is at its very best in the small moments, the little looks."
tt1291584,"Old line-gargler Nolte remains an effortlessly moving presence, while Hardy and Edgerton embody their archetypes and handle the physical demands."
tt1291584,"Mostly, Warrior is a showcase for its up-and-coming stars. Edgerton, from last year's ""Animal Kingdom,"" and Hardy, who stole scenes as the identity forger in ""Inception."""
tt1291584,"O'Conner continues to exhibit a deft knack for melding interpersonal drama with athletic competition in ways that, despite his tales' clichés, earn their melodramatic manipulations through genuine empathy for characters' plights."
tt1291584,"Warrior is a straight genre picture, a fight movie of the old school. But it's a mixed martial arts tale, and as such, it's the best MMA movie ever."
tt1291584,"Yet it still works like gangbusters - tears will be stifled by the end of the sibling vs. sibling finale - and most of the credit should go to Hardy, Nolte and Edgerton."
tt1205489,"A movie at once understated and radical, deceptively unremarkable in presentation and ballsy in its earnestness. Don't let the star's overly familiar squint fool you: This is subtle, perceptive stuff."
tt1205489,"Above all, it feels like a summation of everything he (Eastwood) represents as a filmmaker and a movie star, and perhaps also a farewell."
tt1205489,Perhaps the best thing about Schenk's script is that it enticed Eastwood to end his self-imposed acting hiatus and bring his one-of-a-kind aura back to the screen.
tt1205489,"Mr. Eastwood is also an adept director of his own performances and, perhaps more important, a canny manipulator of his own iconographic presence."
tt1205489,"A lifetime in movies runs through this prime vintage Eastwood performance. You can't take your eyes off him. The no-frills, no-bull Gran Torino made my day."
tt1205489,"It's a meditation, as affecting as it is entertaining, on the limits of violence and the power of unchained empathy."
tt1205489,"An amazingly over-the-top anti-racism parable but, despite its obvious shortcomings, it is nevertheless effective and affecting."
tt1205489,"Eastwood directs with his usual relaxed pace and bursts of intensity, a style that's pleasing to watch--and which, also as usual, never fully compensates for any shortcomings of the script handed to him."
tt1205489,"Highlighted by the star's vastly entertaining performance, this funny, broad but ultimately serious-minded drama about an old-timer driven to put things right in his deteriorating neighborhood looks to be a big audience-pleaser."
tt1205489,"Eastwood has always had the gift for comedy in his acting repertoire, but he indulges in it only rarely. His fans might embrace this return to comedy."
tt0264464,"Part of Spielberg's skill as a filmmaker comes in choosing the right collaborators. Janusz Kaminski's gorgeous cinematography, Michael Kahn's graceful editing, Jeff Nathanson's clever script, and John Williams' score all work well in unison, but the film's masterstroke is the casting of Walken as DiCaprio's utterly decent father."
tt0264464,"Results in about the nicest movie you could ask for at the holidays: a gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices."
tt0264464,Nothing if not a celebration of our willingness to be gulled by life's charming strangers.
tt0264464,"Feels more like The Bill Clinton Story than ""Primary Colors"" (1998). It's a paean to naughty boys who dream of potency and become enraptured by their own scams -- a great American archetype."
tt0264464,"The movie could have used a further dose of the resonance Walken gives it, and a more intellectually adventurous director might have brought the theme close to home."
tt0264464,Brilliant performances by DiCaprio as Frank Jr. and Christopher Walken as his fallen father - and an enjoyable one by Tom Hanks.
tt0264464,"DiCaprio could hardly be better. He brings this outrageous character and his demons to life with skill, sympathy and a symphony of small, telling touches."
tt0264464,Breezily enjoyable but thin.
tt0264464,"Spielberg's inchoate attempts at cultural observation stretch the movie out and dilute the giddiness instead of adding a pleasurable spike. When the movie doesn't feel inflated, it feels soggy."
tt0264464,"Well-enough made and highly watchable, but it lacks the one thing that would put some swing in its step and some swagger in its attitude: a sense of jazz."
tt0096283,"Miyazaki so effectively captures the feeling of a child’s life, inside as well as out, that little ones are often mesmerized by the movie, and adults are returned to a time when they could enjoy mystery for its own sake."
tt0096283,"Here is a children's film made for the world we should live in, rather than the one we occupy. A film with no villains. No fight scenes. No evil adults. No fighting between the two kids. No scary monsters. No darkness before the dawn. A world that is benign. A world where if you meet a strange towering creature in the forest, you curl up on its tummy and have a nap."
tt0096283,An otherworldly tale of childhood and a definitive work of imagination.
tt0096283,"Hayao Miyazaki's family fantasy is full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence, but little icky sentiment."
tt0096283,An animated achievement almost without parallel.
tt0096283,"It’s a film that proves time and again that life itself is the grandest, most galvanizing of all dramas."
tt0096283,"Sheer enchantment, this 1989 animated feature is a key early work by Hayao Miyazaki. It exemplifies Ghibli's style of fanciful realism, paying close attention to minute details as well-drawn figures move across a fluid backdrop. It also deals straightforwardly with substantial emotions like fear of death, though at times it veers toward the heart-tugging cuteness of the Pokemon series."
tt0096283,"An ideal animated film for young children, it has also found favor among adults who appreciate its unusually gentle, painterly style of animation, a trademark of the film's director, Japan's most renowned animator, Hayao Miyazaki."
tt0096283,"When My Neighbor Totoro, which was written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is dispensing enchantment, it can be very charming. Too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff, mechanical chitchat."
tt0096283,Writer-director Hayao Miyazaki has essentially padded a television half-hour into a sluggish theatrical feature.
tt0405159,"Under Eastwood's painstakingly stripped-down direction -- his filmmaking has become the cinematic equivalent of Hemingway's spare though precise prose -- the story emerges as that rarest of birds, an uplifting tragedy."
tt0405159,"Staying at the top of his game when most of his contemporaries have long since hung up their gloves, Clint Eastwood delivers another knockout punch with Million Dollar Baby."
tt0405159,"Eastwood takes the audience to raw, profoundly moving places. If you fear strong emotions, this is not for you. But if you want to see Hollywood filmmaking at its most potent, Eastwood has delivered the real deal."
tt0405159,"Has a beautifully modulated sadness that's almost musical. Eastwood once made a movie about Charlie Parker (""Bird""), but this picture has the smoothly melancholic tones of Coleman Hawkins at his greatest."
tt0405159,"Achieves a mellowness and melancholy that recalls the jazzy dissonance of director (and here, composer) Eastwood's best work: ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" ""Bird,"" ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River."""
tt0405159,"Perhaps the director's most touching, most elegiac work yet, Million Dollar Baby is a film that does both the expected and the unexpected, that has the nerve and the will to be as pitiless as it is sentimental."
tt0405159,"With its careful, unassuming naturalism, its visual thrift and its emotional directness, Million Dollar Baby feels at once contemporary and classical, a work of utter mastery that at the same time has nothing in particular to prove."
tt0405159,"The knockout punch comes from Eastwood. His stripped-down performance -- as powerful as anything he's ever done -- has a rugged, haunting beauty. The same goes for the movie."
tt0405159,It is a rich and challenging motion picture that both affirms life and emphasizes its fragility. Eastwood touches our hearts and energizes our minds without resorting to overt manipulation.
tt0405159,"All the same, Eastwood's point of view has been seasoned enough to locate poignancy and respect for his protagonists where you least expect -- saying it's an old man's movie is a serious compliment."
tt0118849,"Children of Heaven is very nearly a perfect movie for children, and of course that means adults will like it, too."
tt0118849,"Though Majidi draws from familiar Iranian sources, he's made something unique and moving: a sweet tale with a stirring finish."
tt0118849,This modestly produced family drama has all the poignancy and humor associated with today's vibrant Iranian film industry.
tt0118849,"This is a pellucid and gentle film, made with the simplicity and grace of a children's tale and yet its humour, emotional clarity and directness speak directly to adults and children alike - and the pre-teen principals shoulder an adult burden of performance."
tt0118849,Majidi masterfully balances the serious subtext with entertaining vignettes.
tt0118849,"One problem leads to another, but because the children's points of view are so powerfully rendered, the plot of this elegant and lightly magical-realist 1997 drama never seems merely coincidental."
tt0118849,"The poverty that is at the heart of the situation is in prominent relief, yet there is a happiness about their lives that defies sheer gloss. Here is a brother and sister who truly love each other and are bonded by their complicity."
tt0118849,"Haunting in its charm, Children of Heaven opens a window on both contemporary Tehran and the hopeful heart of childhood. This lovely, amusing film deserves a big audience -- especially families. It touches on the innocence of children with tremendous affection."
tt0118849,"In Children of Heaven, life is sweet despite countless hardships, and no reality beyond the economic intrudes upon a fairy tale atmosphere. Only through heavy-handed emphasis does the quest for new sneakers take on any greater meaning."
tt0118849,"Clumsily staged (a bike accident any 15-year-old Super-8 maven could’ve cut better), lit like a soap opera, and acted with all the bribed relish of a peanut butter commercial, Majidi’s movie is merely the simplistic bid being made by every national industry impatient for mass audience attention. Gallingly, it may succeed."
tt0083658,"The grafting of 40s hard-boiled detective story with SF thriller creates some dysfunctional overlaps, and the movie loses some force whenever violence takes over, yet this remains a truly extraordinary, densely imagined version of both the future and the present, with a look and taste all its own."
tt0083658,"Most important, several elements -- the film's tough, new ending; a sly, fleeting dissolve of a unicorn, not in the original; and a brilliant, trompe d'oeil flicker of life in a shot of a still photograph -- bring Deckard's existential dilemma into focus. [11 Sept 1992]"
tt0083658,"May be the best ""new"" American movie released this year."
tt0083658,"This movie is great in any version...I don't miss what has been cut from the new version. The overall effect is so beautifully wrought, a few details aren't going to bring things crashing down."
tt0083658,"Grand enough in scale to carry its many Biblical and mythological references, Blade Runner never feels heavy or pretentious -- only more and more engrossing with each viewing. It helps, too, that it works as pure entertainment."
tt0083658,This is perhaps the only science-fiction film that can be called transcendental.
tt0083658,"What remains is a great Vangelis score, astonishing production design, Hauer's career role -- and a movie that deserves its cult reputation despite an unloving heart. [11 Sept 1992]"
tt0083658,"Today, Blade Runner works better than ever: Scott's version not only has more dramatic integrity, but its visual aesthetic and futuristic vision are more in sync with today's movie-goers. [11 Sept 1992]"
tt0083658,"It looks fabulous, it uses special effects to create a new world of its own, but it is thin in its human story."
tt0083658,"As before, the movie is more impressive for its finely detailed vision of Los Angeles as a futuristic slum than for its story, acting, or message. It's all downhill after the first few eye-dazzling minutes. [2 Oct 1992]"
tt4729430,Sergio Pablos’s film is essentially a metaphor for its own unique and refreshing mode of expression.
tt4729430,The goofy and charming Klaus probably plays better if you don't know going in that it's a Santa Claus origin story.
tt4729430,"It’s far more successful with holiday magic than it is with character-based comedy, but that’s not enough of a flaw to keep young audiences (and their parents) from potentially turning this feature into a cherished annual tradition."
tt4729430,"Sergio Pablos' Klaus invents its own unexpected and very enjoyable origin story for the big guy who gives out toys every Christmas eve. Shaking off most Yuletide cliches in favor of a from-scratch story about how even dubiously-motivated generosity can lead to joy, it contains echoes of other seasonal favorites (especially, in a topsy-turvy way, Dr. Seuss' Grinch) while standing completely on its own."
tt4729430,"It all moves along so amiably, and offers such consistently delightful visuals, that the conventional plot points, up to and including an inevitable “but I can explain” bit, are entirely digestible."
tt4729430,"It’s not remotely as polished as the earlier contenders in the field, but “Klaus” is good enough to have earned a theatrical release, on a par with MGM’s “The Addams Family,” in any event."
tt4729430,Solid first and third acts can’t disguise a so-so middle section stuffed with conventional story beats.
tt4729430,"As admirable as it is that “Klaus” in the overall isn’t a sugar-rush cartoon fix of wisecracks and mayhem, it’s also too lazily reliant on insults and insolence as its go-to mode for comedy. But what does work is the snowy, hilly luster of this bygone-era fairy tale environment, and the seasonal soul the filmmakers have tucked inside their invented history about children’s yearly haul."
tt4729430,"None of the characters in Klaus are as delightful as they are well-drawn, and Pablos’ film never earns the holiday spirit it tries to manufacture down the home stretch. But there’s no denying that the future of “traditional” animation looks a little brighter than it did yesterday, and that’s reason enough to celebrate."
tt4729430,What goodwill the movie does inspire owes more to the splendid visual world than to anything the story supplies.
tt1201607,"Fully justifying the decision, once thought purely mercenary, of splitting J.K. Rowling's final book into two parts, this is an exciting and, to put it mildly, massively eventful finale that will grip and greatly please anyone who has been at all a fan of the series up to now."
tt1201607,"Everything a summer blockbuster should be but rarely is - a whip-smart, slam-bang piece of entertainment where we deeply care about the fate of the central characters."
tt1201607,It's a climax of truly epic proportions.
tt1201607,"The thrilling conclusion to a phenomenal cinematic story 10 years in the telling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is proof that authentic movie excitement is its own form of magic."
tt1201607,"It is indeed impressive; and we mean not just this solid, satisfying final film - in which the Potter saga reaches its climax, if not quite its emotional apex - but the entirety of producer David Heyman's blockbuster franchise."
tt1201607,"With its accelerated rhythm, relentless flow of incident and wizard-war endgame, ""Part 2"" will strike many viewers as a much more exciting, involving picture than the slower, more atmospheric ""Part 1."""
tt1201607,"A worthy farewell that packs in as much action as its seven predecessors combined and manages not to stint on the emotional beats. Harry Potter leaves us as a quiet, bespectacled, corduroy-wearing hero for the ages."
tt1201607,"HPATDH 2 works like a charm. A funereal charm, to be sure, but then, there's no time left for larks."
tt1201607,"With shifting loyalties, unlikely heroes, truths revealed and a little help from friends, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 winds the series up in a most-satisfying fashion."
tt1201607,It's wonderful. Epic and heartbreaking and just as grand as it needs to be.
tt0112471,"Before Sunrise speaks as much to the mind as to the heart, and much of what it says is likely to strike a responsive chord -- a rare and special accomplishment for any motion picture."
tt0112471,"It's a lovely and wistful celebration of youth, time and moments of connection -- and about the experience of living in the midst of a simple, perfect day that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life."
tt0112471,"Richard Linklater goes Hollywood (1995) -- triumphantly and with an overall intelligence, sweetness, and romantic simplicity that reminds me of wartime weepies like The Clock."
tt0112471,"Watching and listening to these two is a charming experience; their conversation has the ring of veracity, and rarely does the viewer's interest stray."
tt0112471,"Though Linklater allows the movie to wander, he never allows the pace to slacken, and more often than not he finds some unexpected bit of found poetry or cultural kitsch to make the digressions worthwhile."
tt0112471,Before Sunrise is so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera - that I found myself remembering real conversations I had experienced with more or less the same words.
tt0112471,Delpy and Hawke begin to grow on you and Linklater and his actors achieve a point midway through the film when the characters are so attractive and smart and emotionally daring that you'll be happy to spend the night with them.
tt0112471,"Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are attractive stars, but what's most appealing about the picture is the value it puts on sharing ideas and feelings through language."
tt0112471,What Mr. Linklater does best here is to come up with conversational gambits that have just the right fancifulness to suit this situation.
tt0112471,Sunrise feels more like an absorbing experiment than a supple success.
tt2024544,"More than a powerful elegy, 12 Years a Slave is a mesmerizing triumph of art and polemics: McQueen turns a topic rendered distant by history into an experience that, short of living through the terrible era it depicts, makes you feel as if you've been there."
tt2024544,"Though the film brims with memorable characters, the show ultimately belongs to Ejiofor, who upholds the character’s dignity throughout."
tt2024544,"Stark, visceral and unrelenting, 12 Years a Slave is not just a great film but a necessary one."
tt2024544,"Elicits from McQueen a directing job that's compellingly humble but also majestic, because his radical showmanship is turned to such precise, human purposes."
tt2024544,"A document that is raw, eloquent, horrifying and essential."
tt2024544,12 Years a Slave is easily the greatest feature film ever made about American slavery.
tt2024544,This revolving door of graphically rendered brutalities might feel like its own punishment if not for an array of astonishing performances that’s practically a one-stop Oscar-nomination shopping spree.
tt2024544,"Perhaps the nature of the story is such that the film can’t help but be obvious and quite melodramatic at times, but it gets better as it goes along and builds to a moving finish."
tt2024544,"Ejiofor’s tightly clenched conviction perfectly embodies hope and righteousness against all odds. He gives the best performance of his career to date, and what’s more, he gives “Slave” its bruised, beating heart with every scene."
tt2024544,Steve McQueen's film practically treats Solomon Norhtup as passive observer to a litany of horrors that exist primarily for our own education.
tt0052618,"Although it is a spectacle film, the story of how a man takes on the tyranny of the Romans, with all sorts of horrible consequences to himself and his family, is powerful and gripping."
tt0052618,Little can come close to captivating the grandeur and epic quality of William Wyler's magnificent bum numb-er.
tt0052618,"Ben-Hur is a majestic achievement, representing a superb blending of the motion picture arts by master craftsmen."
tt0052618,"An extraordinary motion picture, greater in dimension and significance than any similar film of our time, Ben-Hur is more spectacular than any of the previous spectacles. More importantly, it is at the same time a highly rewarding dramatic experience, rich and complex in human values: a great adventure, full of excitement, visual beauty, thrills and unsurpassed cinema artistry."
tt0052618,The artistic quality and taste of Mr. Wyler have prevailed to make this a rich and glowing drama that far transcends the bounds of spectacle. His big scenes are brilliant and dramatic—that is unquestionable. There has seldom been anything in movies to compare with this picture's chariot race.
tt0052618,Predictable but magnificent and satisfying.
tt0052618,"What matters most and comes off best in the picture is the great scenes of spectacle, particularly the chariot race, a superbly handled crescendo of violence that ranks as one of the finest action sequences ever shot. All by itself it would be worth the price of admission."
tt0052618,The race alone is well worth the price of admission.
tt0052618,"A movie like Ben-Hur, while almost never stirring or imaginative in the way that the true epics of Griffith or Gance or Kurosawa are, nevertheless has a basic appeal."
tt2278388,A captivating 1930s-set caper whose innumerable surface pleasures might just seduce you into overlooking its sly intelligence and depth of feeling.
tt2278388,It’s wonderful.
tt2278388,"While it has many familiar ingredients — from the atmosphere to the ensemble of Anderson regulars in nearly every role — in its allegiance to Anderson's vision, everything about The Grand Budapest Hotel is a welcome dose of originality."
tt2278388,"Constant lateral tracks, push-ins, whip-pans, camera moves timed to dialogue, title cards, chapter headings, miniatures, use of stop-action, fetishization of clothing and props, absurdist predicaments — all the techniques Anderson has honed over the years — are used to pinpoint effect here."
tt2278388,"Wes Anderson’s latest cinematic styling is The Grand Budapest Hotel, an exquisitely calibrated, deadpan-comic miniature that expands in the mind and becomes richer and more tragic."
tt2278388,"We should all be so lucky as to live in a world designed, peopled and manipulated by Wes Anderson. His latest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is a dark, daft and deft triumph of design details."
tt2278388,"As off-kilter affecting as we found its nostalgia for a world of charm and dash that really only ever existed in the movies, and as terrific as almost all of the performances are, as a whole package it fell just slightly short of the promise of its parts."
tt2278388,"Full of Anderson’s visual signatures – cameras that swerve, quick zooms, speedy montages – it’s familiar in style, refreshing in tone and one of Anderson’s very best films."
tt2278388,"With this film, Anderson has built a thoroughly likable vision of a prewar Europe – no more real, perhaps, than the kind of Viennese light-operetta that sustained much of 1930s Hollywood – but a distinctive, attractive proposition all the same. It's a nimblefooted, witty piece, but one also imbued with a premonitory sadness at the coming conflagration."
tt2278388,"Wes Anderson’s eighth feature has a heft beneath its icing, heart behind its artifice. Check in, and you won’t want to leave."
tt0047296,"The acting and the best dialogue passages have an impact that has not dimmed; it is still possible to feel the power of the film and of Brando and Kazan, who changed American movie acting forever."
tt0047296,"A draining experience from beginning to end, relentless in its portrayal of inhumanity."
tt0047296,"The chance to watch a four-star classic the way it was meant to be seen -- fresh print, big screen -- is so rare as to be worth the trip."
tt0047296,"As unspoiled in its key elements as the day it was made, ""On the Waterfront"" is indisputably one of the great American films, its power undiminished. Even more today than half a century ago, it demands to be seen."
tt0047296,"On the Waterfront may have baggage, but that doesn't prevent it from being one of the great American productions of the mid-20th century."
tt0047296,It's hard to deny that Marlon Brando's performance as a dock worker and ex-fighter who finally decides to rat on his gangster brother (Rod Steiger) is pretty terrific.
tt0047296,Moviemaking of a rare and high order. (Review of Original Release)
tt0047296,"Under Elia Kazan's direction, Marlon Brando puts on a spectacular show, giving a fascinating, multi-faceted performance."
tt0047296,"Like many cult films, it is also less than the sum of its parts."
tt0047296,"Brando made one of his most indelible impressions in this relentlessly dramatic, ever-controversial tale of loyalty and betrayal in the world of working-class unions."
tt2267998,"Surgically precise, grimly funny and entirely mesmerizing over the course of its swift 149-minute running time, this taut yet expansive psychological thriller represents an exceptional pairing of filmmaker and material."
tt2267998,"It's a hypnotically perverse film, one that redeems your faith in studio smarts (but not, alas, in local law enforcement, tabloid crime reporting or, indeed, marriage)."
tt2267998,Anyone who loved Gone Girl the book will walk out of Gone Girl the movie with a sick grin on their face. You can stop being nervous.
tt2267998,"Not only brutal but also brutally funny, Gone Girl mixes top-notch suspenseful storytelling with the kind of razor-edged wit that slashes so quick and clean you're still watching the blade go past before you notice you're bleeding."
tt2267998,"The movie is phenomenally gripping—although it does leave you queasy, uncertain what to take away on the subject of men, women, marriage, and the possibility of intimacy from the example of such prodigiously messed-up people."
tt2267998,"A sharply made, perfectly cast and unfailingly absorbing melodrama. But, like the director's adaptation of another publishing phenomenon, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, three years ago, it leaves you with a quietly lingering feeling of: “Is that all there is?”"
tt2267998,"For all its simmering malice and buried secrets, it’s worth remembering that this is David Fincher in fun mode: unnerving, shocking and provoking for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, but mostly sickness."
tt2267998,"Gone Girl, finally, may be no more than a storm in a teacup. But what an elegant, bone-china teacup this is. And what a fearsome force-10 gale we have brewing inside."
tt2267998,"Stylish, twisted and daring, Gone Girl is a David Fincher date movie: dark, smart and dangerous. If it doesn’t deliver in its finale, its twist, turns and commitment to moral repugnance will leave you reeling."
tt2267998,"Fincher likely prides himself on turning coal into diamonds at this point, but Flynn's script can feel so retrograde at times that one wonders whether it might have been better served by a De Palma, Bigelow, or even a Verhoeven — which is to say, a filmmaker less concerned with making the lascivious seem prestigious."
tt0050986,This is one of the truly outstanding works of post-war European cinema.
tt0050986,A wonderfully composed movie in which Ingmar Bergman is able to vary the tone from melancholy to gaiety in the most deeply satisfying way
tt0050986,Possibly Ingmar Bergman's finest film and a landmark in film history.
tt0050986,The bitter has not yet overpowered the sweet in this early film from writer-director Ingmar Bergman.
tt0050986,"Initially, Wild Strawberries appears to be an almost pointedly unsubtle coming-of-age story that’s been goosed with dime-store surrealism and male handwringing masked as intellectual engagement with humankind. But the bluntness is a misdirection that underlines the depth of Bergman’s empathy with his hero as well as his dedication to his real subject, which is the process of mentally freeing oneself from an insidiously limiting self-mythology."
tt0050986,"A film that goes where many others have gone (yes, this is Scrooge for Ph.D.s) but with a subtlety few have dreamed of?"
tt0050986,"There's a lot of allegorical baggage on board, but the film's virtues lie in its relative simplicity."
tt0050986,"It's an occasionally over-symbolic work (most notably in the opening nightmare sequence), but it's filled with richly observed characters and a real feeling for the joys of nature and youth."
tt0050986,"For those who think legendary cine-Swede Ingmar Bergman's films are aloof and coldly austere, this warm, welcoming 1957 road movie of aged reflection - the inspiration for Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry - might come as a surprise."
tt0050986,This one is so thoroughly mystifying that we wonder whether Mr. Bergman himself knew what he was trying to say.
tt0072684,"This is a story of identity, and the lack of it. And it’s fascinating."
tt0072684,"Between the vast exteriors and candlelit interiors, the expressive authority of Kubrick’s direction is breathtaking."
tt0072684,Barry Lyndon is a rich cinematic experience which fully deserves to once more be seen on the big screen and enjoy its status as one of Stanley Kubrick’s greatest achievements.
tt0072684,Barry Lyndon is an intimate epic of utter lucidity and command.
tt0072684,"To watch Ryan O’Neal’s performance as the upwardly mobile Barry, part victim and part cad, is to see Kubrick’s perverse genius with actors. He cast a dullard only to jolt us, by the end, with the revelation of the bastard within."
tt0072684,"It’s a movie that actually makes the past look otherworldly, unlike many period pieces, which strive to make history seem easy to slip into."
tt0072684,"Barry Lyndon is another fascinating challenge from one of our most remarkable, independent-minded directors."
tt0072684,Barry Lyndon is a costume epic that pokes fun of other costume epics even as it outdoes them.
tt0072684,"Barry Lyndon isn’t a great success, and it’s not a great entertainment, but it’s a great example of directorial vision."
tt0072684,Kubrick's superb version of William Thackery's first novel is meticulous and philosophically stimulating but it can leave some audiences unmoved on an emotional level.
tt0107207,"For in relating the true story of Conlon's wrongful conviction and 15-year imprisonment, Sheridan has used the tools of the filmmaker to evoke a visceral echo of Conlon's waking nightmare."
tt0107207,"Jim Sheridan skillfully interweaves a myriad of subplots and themes into a fast-paced, cohesive whole."
tt0107207,"Sheridan, however, works with such piercing fervor and intelligence that In the Name of the Father just about transcends its tidy moral design."
tt0107207,"And, riskiest of all, the film makers eschewed another grainy documentary go at the subject in favor of a movie drama of one of the most compelling true stories of the modern troubles."
tt0107207,In the Name of the Father is as good a compromise of fact and fiction as you could hope for -- and still call it a movie.
tt0107207,"The picture turns into a kind of stylized morality play about the right and the wrong ways for Irishmen to respond to distorted portraits of their character, and it's terrifically effective."
tt0107207,"But the acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicities of the script, and whenever Day-Lewis or Postlethwaite is on-screen the movie crackles."
tt0107207,"By the end of the movie, whether or not you're a member of Sinn Fein, the Brits' brutality toward the Conlons will get your Irish up."
tt0107207,"The movie does a harrowing job of showing how, and why, a man might be made to confess to a bombing he didn't commit."
tt0107207,"He gets much of what he wants, but not all of it, and not all of the time - the film is just too eclectic on occasion, a bit jumpy in its tone and its pacing."
tt0077416,"What distinguishes The Deer Hunter most is its many rich characters and the size of its vision. This is a big film, dealing with big issues, made on a grand scale. Much of it, including some casting decisions, suggest inspiration by ""The Godfather."" [9 Mar 1979]"
tt0077416,"Brutally memorable, The Deer Hunter is an emotionally draining production that draws a vivid portrait of its characters and their milieu--and succeeds in showing the devastating effect of the war on their lives, as well as their brave attempts at renewal. Unfortunately, the film falters when it comes to the larger questions of America's involvement in Vietnam."
tt0077416,It is not an anti-war film. It is not a pro-war film. It is one of the most emotionally shattering films ever made.
tt0077416,A simultaneuosly touching and harrowing experience that puts the audience directly in the shoes of one man's experience of Vietnam.
tt0077416,"The idea of sacrifice permeates everything, along with the cruelty and horror. This is Cimino's masterpiece."
tt0077416,"A big, awkward, crazily ambitious, sometimes breathtaking motion picture that comes as close to being a popular epic as any movie about this country since ""The Godfather."""
tt0077416,"Among the considerable achievements of Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is the fact that the film remains intense, powerful and fascinating for more than three hours."
tt0077416,"Overlong, but with moments of greatness."
tt0077416,"While the results are far from unprofessional--the cast is uniformly good, including a characteristically slapped-around Meryl Streep...The male self-pity is so overwhelming that you'll probably stagger out of this mumbling something about Tolstoy (as many critics did when the film first came out in 1978) if you aren't as nauseated as I was."
tt0077416,A romantic adolescent boy&#146;s view of friendship.
tt2119532,"While derivative and endlessly cheesy, it’s a characteristically visceral return for Gibson, and one that confirms that little has changed in the man’s singular artistic psyche."
tt2119532,"As repellent a figure as many may still find Gibson, I have to report he’s absolutely hit Hacksaw Ridge out of the park."
tt2119532,"Themes of courage, patriotism, faith and unwavering adherence to personal beliefs have been a constant through Gibson's directing projects, as has a fascination with bloodshed and gore. Those qualities serve this powerful true story of heroism without violence extremely well, overcoming its occasional cliched battle-movie tropes to provide stirring drama."
tt2119532,"Overall, there aren’t many shades of gray in Hacksaw Ridge, but it’s a movie that fulfills its purpose with vigor, confidence and swagger, and those battle scenes are impossible to take your eyes off."
tt2119532,"Hacksaw Ridge returns to the themes which have professionally and personally motivated 60-year-old Gibson for his entire life; he’s never been subtle, but he’s certainly effective when it comes to delivering his heart-felt message."
tt2119532,Hacksaw Ridge is the work of a director possessed by the reality of violence as an unholy yet unavoidable truth.
tt2119532,"While Hacksaw Ridge is undeniably made with great care and skill, for all of its good intentions it can never refute that famous Truffaut observation that making an anti-war film is essentially impossible, since to portray something is to ennoble it. In celebrating this legendary pacifist, Gibson and company ennoble the hell out of violence."
tt2119532,"There's no getting away from it, Gibson has produced another bombastic, crowd-pleasing and obviously blood-soaked movie which expertly glorifies that which its hero was against."
tt2119532,"Along with screenwriters Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight, Gibson, whose lack of directorial subtlety but skill with action both reach an apex here, is not content to tell the true story of Desmond Doss and his unshakeable, courage-giving faith. He wants to convince us that his faith was, in fact, the truth."
tt2119532,"A blood-soaked, bone-crunching hymn to religious devotion and faith, Hacksaw Ridge doesn’t hum Mel Gibson’s favorite themes; it shouts them."
tt0041959,"Of all the movies I have seen, this one most completely embodies the romance of going to the movies."
tt0041959,"Throughout the film the sense of Vienna as a frazzled echo of its glorious past is underpinned by Reed's greatest trouvaille – the discovery of Anton Karas's zither melodies, used as the only musical accompaniment. Half-jaunty, half-melancholic, they epitomise, like the film itself, a world gone sadly to seed."
tt0041959,"This will haunt you. The style, the plot, the character and of course ...that tune..."
tt0041959,A noir classic.
tt0041959,"A triumph of disparate tones, colors and intentions. Like many, I have loved this thriller of conscience and betrayal most of my moviegoing life...Its brand of romantic fatalism is particularly seductive to teenage males, I think, and those who never fully recover from that moviegoing state of being."
tt0041959,"Mr. Reed has brilliantly packaged the whole bad of his cinematic tricks, his whole range of inventive genius for making the camera expound. His eminent gifts for compressing a wealth of suggestion in single shots, for building up agonized tension and popping surprises are fully exercised. His devilishly mischievous humor also runs lightly through the film, touching the darker depressions with little glints of the gay or macabre. [3 Feb 1950, p.29]"
tt0041959,"It's an exciting experience, dazzling and entertaining and thought-provoking. I saw it at Cinema 21 last week and immediately wanted to see it again. I couldn't, so I started researching and read everything I could about it. It's truly great."
tt0041959,"Supporting characters turn in excellent portrayals. Camera work on an exceptionally high plane, and in his painstaking direction Carol Reed lives up to his high reputation."
tt0041959,The Third Man finally endures because it offers a simple thing that so many modern films neglect: the power of story...Revolutionary film noir with a clutch of stunning central turns.
tt0041959,"What has perhaps been lost over the years, however, is the cultural freshness and vitality of Reed’s masterpiece...The Third Man is important not just because of its technique but because of its theme."
tt0046268,"Here's where it's easiest to see Clouzot's advantage over his more famous peer, as he combines nail-biting action scenes - calibrated to the millimeter - with a Hawksian command of earthy performances."
tt0046268,The film's extended suspense sequences deserve a place among the great stretches of cinema.
tt0046268,"Wages of Fear is the kind of motion picture for which commonplace phrases like ""white-knuckle tension ride"" have been coined."
tt0046268,"Excellent, but nasty stuff."
tt0046268,"Deriving endless anxiety from brawny men moving as gingerly as possible, it’s a riveting anti-action movie, one of the most memorable high-concept pictures ever made in Europe."
tt0046268,"A precursor of The Wild Bunch, it is an expertly directed, personally felt film."
tt0046268,"This film, the inspiration for the less successful Sorcerer, is a textbook case of how to handle suspense. It has also been called the cruelest movie ever made and it certainly earns that title by the film's end."
tt0046268,Henri-Georges Clouzot’s The Wages of Fear now seems much less like Salt of the Earth-as-a-potboiler and a lot more like the spiritual godfather to every testosterone-fueled thrill ride since.
tt0046268,"The excitement derives entirely from the awareness of nitroglycerine and the gingerly, breathless handling of it. You sit there waiting for the theatre to explode."
tt0046268,"A significant influence on Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, this grueling pile driver of a movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, though it reeks of French 50s attitude, which includes misogyny, snobbishness, and borderline racism."
tt0353969,"Suspenseful, surprising, and psychologically rich."
tt0353969,"It takes enormous skill to pull off such a high-wire act without diminishing the gravity of the situation, but Bong and his first-rate cast are up to the task."
tt0353969,"It's an altogether remarkable piece of work, deepening the genre while whipping its skin off, satirizing an entire nation's nearsighted apathy as it wonders, almost aloud, about the nature of truth, evidence, and social belonging."
tt0353969,A haunting score and beautifully atmospheric cinematography by Kim Hyung-gu round out the achievements of this unique and engaging Korean thriller.
tt0353969,"A powerful, slow-burning portrait of human fallibility."
tt0353969,"What distinguishes Memories of Murder, setting it apart from rank-and-file thrillers, is its singular mix of gallows humor and unnerving solemnity."
tt0353969,"Uses dark humor, incisive characterizations and social commentary to infuse its familiar detective tale with a distinctive flair."
tt0353969,As exciting for its narrative twists and turns as for its Korean textures and rhythms.
tt0353969,Becomes something of a rainswept Korean koan on both the nobility and futility of persistence in the face of obviously insurmountable odds.
tt0353969,"The script is as sloppy as Song's unkempt cop, sprinkled with intriguing ideas and imaginative details that, like the investigation, simply get lost in blind alleys."
tt3011894,"Beyond being very smart and funny, it's also a great looking movie."
tt3011894,"While adhering to an internal logic that makes each punchline land with a satisfying burst of glee, the movie nevertheless stems from genuine fury aimed a broken world. It's the rare storytelling endeavor that manages to be laughably absurd and profoundly tragic at the same time."
tt3011894,"Wild Tales is loose-limbed, rowdy, and exhilarating — in its vibrant lunacy, and with its cartoonishly brash violence, it's a little bit Almodóvar, a little bit Tarantino."
tt3011894,Szifron does a terrific job of pacing thanks to expert editing (he shares credit with Pablo Barbieri) within each episode and a genuinely subversive sense of humor.
tt3011894,"It's crisply and cleanly shot throughout, and the filmmaker shows a rare feel for how to not only make comedy land, but also to make it actually feel cinematic too."
tt3011894,Each of the six vignettes that make up this unusually energetic anthology pertains to the methods of calculated mass dehumanization that are (barely) hidden beneath the practices of social institutions.
tt3011894,"Wild Tales opens and closes with a bang, and at its best is a riotously funny and cathartic exorcism of the frustrations of contemporary life."
tt3011894,"There’s a good deal of the sick-and-twisted element of The ABCs Of Death here, but managed with better pacing, more maturity, and more room to build each segment."
tt3011894,"As we pass from one story to another the relentless savagery does get a bit grinding. In addition, at two hours in length, Szifron's film is perhaps one skit too long. Regardless, Wild Tales is an inventive, occasionally hysterical ride."
tt3011894,"Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but Argentine writer-director Damián Szifron allows it to sit until it congeals in the dreary six-part anthology Wild Tales."
tt0031679,"Demonstrating that the greatest political evil is indifference, this appeal to a world on the verge of war has lost none of its relevance."
tt0031679,"There’s tremendous dramatic impact threaded throughout the picture, interwoven with those deft human episodes which have become familiar with Capra’s direction in previous pictures. He keys the motivation of his basic premise without wasting time, and then carries it through vigorously."
tt0031679,"[Capra] has paced it beautifully and held it in perfect balance, weaving his romance lightly through the political phases of his comedy, flicking a sardonic eye over the Washington scene, racing out to the hinterland to watch public opinion being made and returning miraculously in time to tie all the story threads together into a serious and meaningful dramatic pattern."
tt0031679,"While MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is the most moral of films, it is so artfully filled with real emotion that it never becomes heavy-handed."
tt0031679,"The acting of the brilliant cast is sometimes superb. But Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is bigger than any of these things. Its real hero is not calfy Jeff Smith, but the things he believes, as embodied in the hero of U. S. democracy's first crisis, Abraham Lincoln."
tt0031679,Quintessential Capra - popular wish-fulfilment served up with such fast-talking comic panache that you don't have time to question its cornball idealism.
tt0031679,"This is classic Capracorn, with the greatest girl cynic of the 30s, Jean Arthur."
tt0031679,"No one else can balance the ups and downs of wistful sentiment and corny humor the way Capra can - but if anyone else should learn to, kill him."
tt0031679,Clumsy and irritating.
tt1392190,"There is nothing easy or predictable about what George Miller delivers with Mad Max: Fury Road, a stone-cold action master class, beautiful and brainy and startling in the ways it throws off the current definition of the blockbuster."
tt1392190,"There is gargantuan excess here, to be sure — and no shortage of madness — but there is also an astonishing level of discipline."
tt1392190,"The world of Mad Max has always been welded together from bits of whatever was lying around, and the films’ brilliance has always been in their welding – the ingenious ways in which their scrap-metal parts were combined to create something unthinkable, hilarious or obscene, and often all three."
tt1392190,"Marrying the biting frenzy of Terry Gilliam’s film universe with the explosive grandeur of James Cameron, Miller cooks up some exhilaratingly sustained action. But the key to this symphony of twisted metal is how the film never forgets that violence is a sort of madness."
tt1392190,Where Fury Road stands apart from so much of today’s action cinema is that the human element remains front and center.
tt1392190,The first two Max features ran barely 90 minutes and it takes guts and real confidence to dare push a straight chase film with very little dialogue to two hours. But Miller has pulled it off by coming up with innumerable new elements to keep the action compelling.
tt1392190,"""Mad Max"" doesn't just depict conflicts with evildoers in a tattered existence. It delivers a rare alternative to aggressively stupid action movies. At a time of great need, Max rides again."
tt1392190,"Come for the blistering, full-tilt action, stay for the thought-provoking consideration of the post-apocalypse."
tt1392190,"That adjective in the title is accurate. Extravagantly deranged, ear-splittingly cacophonous, and entirely over the top, George Miller has revived his Mad Max punk-western franchise as a bizarre convoy chase action-thriller in the post-apocalyptic desert."
tt1392190,"For a while, Fury Road’s complete disinterest in screenwriting fundamentals feels liberating, as the director keeps upping the ante on this desperate chase through the desert. But what feels liberating at first can become monotonous, and Fury Road starts to drag once the frenetic sameness of Miller’s strategy takes hold."
tt10366206,"John Wick: Chapter 4’s incredibly staged set pieces, engaging ensemble, and stylish production design coalesce into a modern action masterclass."
tt10366206,"Pure power, John Wick: Chapter 4 is as exhilarating as it is exhausting. With this wildly satisfying world tour de force, Reeves’ Wick transcends icon status delivering the perfect bone-crunching crescendo to one of the great action franchises in cinema history. It’s pure gold."
tt10366206,"If more world-building, bigger action, and a deeper embrace of what its leading man does well all perk up your ears, you know what you need to know. As someone who has been in the tank for these movies for nearly a decade now, the fourth film is everything I wanted out of these movies. Yeah, I'm thinking he's back."
tt10366206,"Bigger, badder, bolder, longer, and featuring nearly more spectacular set pieces than one movie can comfortably handle, this epic action film practically redefines the stakes."
tt10366206,"Even when it drags — 169 minutes is a lot of time to fill, even for this masterful crew — the film gamely mixes comedy, action, and drama into one truly satisfying cocktail."
tt10366206,"As Wick carves a path of stoic destruction across several continents, the series' longtime director Chad Stahelski, once Reeves' Matrix stand-in and longtime stunt coordinator, gets down to the business of what he loves best: creative kills, far-flung zip codes, and incalculable body counts."
tt10366206,"More turns out to be just about right in this case, with the film offering up such an onslaught of brutal, breakneck action that it’s easy to forgive its less compelling narrative excesses."
tt10366206,"Watching John Wick: Chapter 4 sometimes felt like watching an above-average assembly cut. At an unwieldy two hours and 49 minutes, your eye will immediately be drawn to what cuts through the noise — and there are plenty of these moments. But “moments” does not a well-told “movie” make."
tt10366206,"In the gradual development and expansion of the Wickaverse, the filmmakers seem to have lost the thread of what makes the first and, at times, second film in the series work so well."
tt10366206,"Those who appreciated the original for its brutal, sinewy agility have another thing coming: a lumbering, stultifying gargantua of a film willing to kill everything except its darlings."
tt0892769,"Rouses you in conventional ways, but it's also the rare animated film that uses 3-D for its breathtaking spatial and emotional possibilities."
tt0892769,"An exciting, fun and sensationally entertaining movie for everyone."
tt0892769,A thrilling drama interspersed with amusing comedic elements (rather than the other way around).
tt0892769,Works enough miracles of 3-D animation to charm your socks off.
tt0892769,"In steering a course between the rock of rude humor and the hard place of perilous drama, How to Train Your Dragon flies high."
tt0892769,A 3D movie that will intrigue kids and adults alike but might play raggedly in both camps.
tt0892769,"Baruchel is outstanding, giving Hiccup just the right amount of confidence buried several layers beneath the shame he feels in not continuing the family business. Butler's a head-banger from way back, so he's convincing. And Ferrera gets the grrl-power vibe just right."
tt0892769,"Dreamworks hired the directors of ""Lilo & Stitch"" to turn Cressida Cowell’s romp of a novel into an animated film and can’t be too surprised that they made, in essence, ""Hiccup and Stitch."""
tt0892769,"You could chalk this kid’s flick up as another manic Saturday-matinee time killer if it weren’t for a singularly impressive element. It’s not the stretchy, lava-lamp–ish animation, which offers the usual in-your-face 3-D tricks."
tt0892769,Adequate but unremarkable animated tale.
tt0097165,"Hurrah! Poetry and passion, comedy and tragedy are fused into one absolutely marvelous affirmation of independent spirit in Dead Poets Society. [2 June 1989, Daily Notebook, p.E1]"
tt0097165,One of Australian director Peter Weir's most sensitive films.
tt0097165,The picture draws out the obvious and turns itself into a classic. [26 June 1989]
tt0097165,"Sure, the heroes and villains are arranged in a convenient moral gallery. But the performances, Weir's adroit direction and John Seale's superb cinematography take care of that banality."
tt0097165,"Nothing about this film sounds, as described, novel. Yet it grips, because it has been made with plentiful feeling and vigor. [June 26, 1989]"
tt0097165,Sings whenever Williams is onscreen.
tt0097165,"Commands respect and affection. [2 June 1989, Calendar, p.6-1]"
tt0097165,"Williams is impressively restrained as well as funny, so fans need not fret. It only means that instead of Good Morning, Preppies, we're given a bittersweet, even eerie Goodbye, Mr. Hip. [2 June 1989, Life, p.1D]"
tt0097165,"Williams, who has comparatively little screen time, has come to act, not to cut comic riffs, and he does so with forceful, ultimately compelling, simplicity. [June 5, 1989]"
tt0097165,"Not the worst of the countless recent movies about good kids and hidebound, authoritatian older people. It may, however, be the most shameless in its attempt to pander to an adolescent audience."
tt0198781,"As giddy and antic as any great Warner Bros. cartoon of the 1930s and '40s -- it bears seeing more than once, if only to allow for the sight gags that play second fiddle to the plot, a rarity in animation -- but also resonant and real. In other words, it's the perfect movie."
tt0198781,"A terrific piece of work: smart, inventive and executed with state-of-the-art finesse."
tt0198781,"It comes from Pixar, the animation studio that scored with the ""Toy Story"" series and ""A Bug's Life,"" and it has more zip and a tad less soul than those predecessors."
tt0198781,"The climax, featuring what's essentially a suspended roller coaster of closet doors, is as thrilling as it is imaginative."
tt0198781,"Not quite up to the exalted level of the two predecessors (""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2""), be assured it's still the most eye-popping and thoroughly entertaining animated film to come down the pike so far this year."
tt0198781,"Confirms that despite all the technical tools at their disposal, one thing counts head and shoulders above razzle-dazzle eye candy (or anything else, for that matter): the story and characters, and Monsters, Inc. introduces worthy additions to the Pixar pantheon."
tt0198781,"Rarely does an animated character merge as perfectly with the persona of the actor providing his voice as the star of Monsters, Inc. does with John Goodman."
tt0198781,"It's a good movie, mind you, with great bits in it, but it still falls short of rapture."
tt0198781,"Though it has its charms, Monsters, Inc. does not measure up. As a childhood entertainment it is certainly fine, but Pixar's celebrated lure for adults is largely absent."
tt0198781,"But Monsters, Inc. -- directed by Pixar soldier Pete Docter, not by master digital comic John Lasseter -- turns out to be stingy on context, commentary, and the prism-ing view of pop culture that made the earlier films mint."
tt0050976,"The directness of The Seventh Seal is its strength: This is an uncompromising film, regarding good and evil with the same simplicity and faith as its hero."
tt0050976,"Ingmar Bergman's dark masterpiece effortlessly sees off the revisionists and the satirists; it is a radical work of art that reaches back to scripture, to Cervantes and to Shakespeare to create a new dramatic idiom of its own."
tt0050976,"A piercing and powerful contemplation of the passage of man upon this earth. Essentially intellectual, yet emotionally stimulating, too, it is as tough—and rewarding—a screen challenge as the moviegoer has had to face this year."
tt0050976,Dark but beautiful.
tt0050976,"Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of hopeful humanity, The Seventh Seal is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning(lessness) of this mortal coil."
tt0050976,Prepare to fawn at Bergman’s most metaphysically profound film; you may even laugh.
tt0050976,"What's most important here is that THE SEVENTH SEAL, for all its downbeat aspects, is so gripping as to be entertaining in an enlightening way. Less austere and more visually striking than some of Bergman's later films."
tt0050976,"There’s a lot going on in Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, with its striking imagery, bawdy humor, and grim suffering; it’s a humane film about the inhumane inevitability of death. I’m still not much of a cinephile (this is my second Bergman film, and I only watched The Virgin Spring so I could compare it in an essay to The Last House On The Left), but I’m coming to realize that the difference between a good movie and a great one are those moments of intense personal connection where it seems like the filmmaker is reaching out to you through the screen and whispering (or yelling, or cajoling, or demanding, or pleading) in your ear. As if there is no real distance between you and the director, time has changed nothing, and the moment remains as pure as it was on the day it was filmed."
tt0050976,"The Seventh Seal, assisted by cinematographer Gunnar Fischer’s richly overexposed images, operates as though it contains the undiluted essence of life’s fueling dialectic formula. Occasionally it does, most notably in the terrifying arrival of the self-flagellants to a weak-willed village. But the road-trippers in Bergman’s follow-up, Wild Strawberries, achieve a far greater grace and clarity with only a fraction of the heavy lifting."
tt0050976,The film in fact consists of a series of dull speeches spun on simple themes; Bergman barely tries to make the material function dramatically.
tt0073195,One of the most effective thrillers ever made.
tt0073195,"It was the complete nightmare that invented the ""summer blockbuster"", launched the genius on a global scale and delivered an astonishingly effective thriller built on a very primal level: fear."
tt0073195,"Steven Spielberg overcame the lumpy plotting of Peter Benchley's novel to create an efficient, graceful fright machine in Jaws."
tt0073195,"The first is the best. When it comes to this kind of thriller, no movie has been able to top Jaws, although many have tried. And, as the years go by, it seems increasingly unlikely that anything will come close."
tt0073195,"Robert Shaw [is] absolutely magnificent as a coarse fisherman finally hired to locate the Great White Shark; and Richard Dreyfuss, in another excellent characterization as a likeable young scientist."
tt0073195,"Importantly, Spielberg instinctively knows exactly when to keep his camera still and allow what's in front of it to take precedence."
tt0073195,"If you think about Jaws for more than 45 seconds you will recognize it as nonsense, but it's the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun, if you like to have the wits scared out of you at irregular intervals."
tt0073195,"From the outrageously frightening opening--in which a beautiful young woman skinny-dipping in the moonlight is devoured by the unseen shark--to the claustrophobic climax aboard Quint's fishing boat, Spielberg has us in his grip and rarely lets go."
tt0073195,"What this movie is about, and where it succeeds best, is the primordial level of fear. The characters, for the most part, and the non-fish elements in the story, are comparatively weak and not believable. [20 June 1975]"
tt0073195,"Steven Spielberg's mechanical thriller is guaranteed to make you scream on schedule (John Williams's score even has the audience reactions programmed into the melodies), particularly if your tolerance for weak motivation and other minor inconsistencies is high."
tt3170832,Room is more than the title of one of the year’s most powerful movies — it’s a state of mind that’s unbearably tense and as claustrophobic as a straitjacket
tt3170832,Room is simply a movie about mother and son trying to adapt to the outside world after years of forced captivity. And the surprise is how succinctly it captures this drastic life change from the perspective of five-year-old.
tt3170832,"Director Lenny Abrahamson seamlessly translates Donoghue's work into cinematic terms with his relentlessly compelling adaptation. However, the drama owes just as much to its two stars, Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay, whose textured performances turn outrageous circumstances into a tense and surprisingly credible survival tale."
tt3170832,"The film, never sensational or saccharine, is a tough but tender tribute to the creative power of maternal love."
tt3170832,"There are some plausibility issues in Room, but this is a disturbing and absorbing film, shrewdly acted, particularly by Larson. It lets the audience in; it does not just let the nightmare stun them into submission. You make a real emotional engagement."
tt3170832,"If Abrahamson were as gifted with a camera as he was with his cast (he inspires subtlety even from the tiny Tremblay), Room could have been truly worthy of the astonishing performances that provide its foundation."
tt3170832,"It’s a testament to the story’s underlying integrity that, even when deprived of some of the elements that made Emma Donoghue’s 2010 book so gripping, director Lenny Abrahamson’s inevitably telescoped but beautifully handled adaptation retains considerable emotional impact."
tt3170832,"Room has unforgettable, must-witness performances, and its soulful mother and son narrative is one of the most touching dynamics you’ll see in theaters this year."
tt3170832,"Overall, it’s a decent shot at a tall target, but real credit is due the lead actors, with Larson expanding beyond the already considerable range she’s previously shown with an exceedingly dimensional performance in a role that calls for running the gamut, and Tremblay always convincing without ever becoming cloying."
tt3170832,"It ought to be a triumph. Somehow, though, it lacks the flooding emotional force Donoghue gave it on the page."
tt0118715,"It's paved with delightfully irregular and unanticipated bits of business that stimulate the viewer to stay fully alert, while renewing our faith in the sheer joy of watching movies."
tt0118715,"It's a pinball arcade of a flick -- the Coens invent a bunch of wonderfully flaky characters, stick them into a Plexiglas narrative, and let them bounce off each other."
tt0118715,"Some may complain The Big Lebowski rushes in all directions and never ends up anywhere. That isn't the film's flaw, but its style."
tt0118715,"Viewers with a taste for bizarre, even surreal, humor will have a ball."
tt0118715,It's neither the clean strike Coen-heads expected after Fargo nor the gutter ball anticipated by Coen-phobes like myself.
tt0118715,The Big Lebowski is packed with show-offy filmmaking and as a result is pretty entertaining.
tt0118715,"Nearly everything in The Big Lebowski is a put-on, but all that leaves you with is the Coens' bizarrely over-deliberate, almost Teutonic form of rib nudging."
tt0118715,"Although some of its parts are brilliantly executed and played by a terrific cast, the result is scattered, overamplified and unsatisfying."
tt0118715,"It is a visual tour de force, but as a whole the movie slowly deflates into a cross between ""Arizona"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy""."
tt0118715,"If it's all supposed to be in fun, why does it feel so much like an insult?"
tt0046438,"Hardly anything actually happens, and yet it's one of the most emotionally involving dramas ever made."
tt0046438,"Tokyo Story moves quite slowly by our Western standards, and requires more patience at first than some moviegoers may be willing to supply. Its effect is cumulative, however; the pace comes to seem perfectly suited to the material."
tt0046438,[Hara's] sad dignity and emotional generosity are compelling.
tt0046438,"Yasujiro Ozu's portrait of familial relations, first seen in 1953, is marked by an indefinable melancholy that settles on the frame as softly as snow."
tt0046438,"Even on the basis of a limited exposure to his work, the story seems archetypal Ozu."
tt0046438,"In this exquisite merging of specific and universal, infinite and infinitesimal, Tokyo Story perhaps most clearly illuminates that Ozu is not the most Japanese of filmmakers, but the most human."
tt0046438,"Above all, Hara's smile and Ryu's sigh are a touching show of good faith and the genuine pleasure they take in each other's company–which, of course, makes their response to life's disappointments all the more poignant."
tt0046438,"Tokyo Story, Ozu’s 1953 magnum opus, has frequently been acclaimed by filmmakers and critics alike as the greatest film ever made, and it very arguably could be. Regardless of where you’d place it on the hierarchy of the “best ever’s"", Tokyo Story is certainly the ultimate family film—that is, the ultimate film about family and what family actually means."
tt0046438,"The movie...remains perhaps the wisest of family dramas, an experience as wrenching as it is restorative."
tt0046438,"This 1953 classic is one of the cinema's most profound and moving studies of married love, ageing and the relations between parents and children. It is flawless and rewards numerous viewings."
tt1950186,"The chemistry between Bale and Damon is what makes the movie move the way it does, along with the script. Bale alone in the race car figuring out how to win and survive is where the film really sings."
tt1950186,Ford v Ferrari is the sort of cinematic entertainment that sucks you in and won’t let you go until you cross the finish line.
tt1950186,The film’s lively dynamics owe much to the bristly nature of nearly every relationship and interaction in the film.
tt1950186,"It’s a movie so well put together as a hero’s tale that it moves along almost too smoothly; the script by brothers Jez and John Henry Butterworth hits its marks of tragedy and triumph with a kind of shiny, measured inevitability."
tt1950186,"Ford v Ferrari is an easy film to scoff at; there is nothing new here, and there is no debating that fact. Instead, we have a compelling story told in simple, intelligent fashion. It deserves a spot on the list of great racing dramas, and the list of the year’s most entertaining dramas."
tt1950186,"Damon and Bale are such magnetic onscreen figures that it doesn’t take much to inject their various arguments, smarmy asides, and high-stakes bets with plenty of intrigue."
tt1950186,"Watching Bale and Damon channel those two speed freaks in all of their surly, testosterone-spitting glory is a reminder of how much fun it was to watch Bale play a similar character opposite Mark Wahlberg in “The Fighter.”"
tt1950186,"At a time when the nation continues to weigh the fate of its auto industry, James Mangold’s depiction of the Ford Motor Company facing its first major financial threat transparently plays to nostalgic reveries of the industry’s golden age."
tt1950186,Two immensely enjoyable central performances and some of the best race sequences yet filmed fuel an otherwise standard sports movie.
tt1950186,It is crammed with unearned emotional moments and factory-built male characters whose dedication to their sport we are expected to find adorable and heroic by turns.
tt0019254,"A stark and intense film, Jeanne d'Arc is renowned for its sparse shooting style - which focuses in on Falconetti's face with such relentless fascination that everything else (sets, props, secondary characters) disappear from view."
tt0019254,"To modern audiences, raised on films where emotion is conveyed by dialogue and action more than by faces, a film like The Passion of Joan of Arc is an unsettling experience--so intimate we fear we will discover more secrets than we desire."
tt0019254,"The last silent film by Danish master Carl Theodor Dreyer, it largely eschewed traditional master shots for a dazzling range of expressive, character-probing close-ups: no historical biopic has ever felt quite so unnervingly intimate."
tt0019254,Danish director Carl Dreyer's 1928 film The Passion Of Joan Of Arc is one of the indisputable masterpieces of the silent era.
tt0019254,"Dreyer’s radical approach to constructing space and the slow intensity of his mobile style make this “difficult” in the sense that, like all the greatest films, it reinvents the world from the ground up. It’s also painful in a way that all Dreyer’s tragedies are, but it will continue to live long after most commercial movies have vanished from memory."
tt0019254,"The chief reason for its legendary reputation is the brilliant match between its timeless historical subject - the trial that required Joan to defend her faith before skeptical representatives of church and state - and Dreyer's decision to film it primarily in relentless close-ups, using the sharply etched faces of his performers to suggest the invisible spiritual struggles going on beneath the drama's human dimensions."
tt0019254,"The Passion of Joan of Arc remains the moment that [Dreyer] guided his medium to new heights, and also crafted a work that would endure outside of any specific context."
tt0019254,"FRANCE can well be proud of that great picture, The Passion of Jeanne d'Arc, for while Carl Dreyer, a Dane, is responsible for the conspicuously fine and imaginative use of the camera, it is the gifted performance of Maria Falconetti as the Maid of Orleans that rises above everything in this artistic achievement."
tt0019254,It is among the most powerful early arguments in favor of a minimalist approach to filmmaking and champions the effectiveness of the close-up when used properly. It's hard to imagine anyone today arguing its place in the pantheon of Silent Olympians.
tt0019254,"In the hands of the great Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer it becomes a potent saga of battered faith, vicious bullying and personal torment."
tt0395169,"Cheadle impressively carries the entire picture, delivering the kind of note-perfect performance that's absolutely deserving of Oscar consideration."
tt0395169,"The film turns into a triumph for Don Cheadle, who never steps outside the character for emotional grandstanding or easy moralism."
tt0395169,"It is a powerful portrait of a slightly befuddled man who, when inhuman demands were placed on him, found within himself an unexpected response."
tt0395169,"Hotel Rwanda, based on real lives and events, aims unequivocally to break your heart."
tt0395169,"Ultimately, one's reservations are overwhelmed by the story's urgency; it's impossible not to be shattered."
tt0395169,"George has been criticized for simplifying a complex story into an African ""Schindler's List."" But despite flaws in execution, this is a film of rare courage and imperishable heart."
tt0395169,"The genocide of some one million Rwandan Tutsis by their Hutu neighbors remains a disgraceful and too-little-known episode in recent world history. Alas, Terry George's ineffectual Hotel Rwanda only partly rectifies that problem, taking what ought to have been a complex, powerful inquiry and simplifying it to a story about the resilience of the human spirit."
tt0395169,"It's a gut-twisting story handled, largely and predictably, with asbestos mitts."
tt0395169,"The story it tells is such a wrenching one it cannot help but move us, especially when the performance of a lifetime by Don Cheadle is added to the mix."
tt0395169,"The film presents the Rwandans in the worst possible way: venal, corrupt, vicious, stupid, barbaric and completely incapable of governing themselves. Honestly, I've seen more intelligent and sympathetic depictions of Africans in Tarzan movies."
tt0075148,"On paper, neither character may seem terribly appealing, but on the screen they steal your heart away, but completely...Not only did that last reel include some of the most wildly exciting fight footage ever put on the screen, but it also provided an emotionally gratifying capstone to a picture that is truly an ode to the human spirit."
tt0075148,"By now, everyone knows who wins, but the scenes before the fight set us up for it so completely, so emotionally, that when it's over we've had it. We're drained."
tt0075148,The basic storyline has been done to death over the years; this is still one of the most effective and successful applications of the formula.
tt0075148,"Stallone is totally engaging Rocky playing him with a mixture of boyish intensity, lusty sensuality and cheerful innocence. And Shire is equally appealing, slowly blossoming into a vibrant young woman, and Burt Young seethes with anger as her embittered brother."
tt0075148,"This is really Sly's movie as he slugs his way through a heartfelt performance and delivers some cracking punches, both literally and emotionally."
tt0075148,"A great movie? Hardly. Stallone as the next Brando? You've got to be kidding. A nice little fantasy picture? Maybe. That's the hype and reality of Rocky, the flatout schmaltzy saga of a Philadelphia club boxer who, on New Year's Day of our Bicentennial Year, gets a chance to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. . . ."
tt0075148,"I wanted to like it more than I did, but it'll do."
tt0075148,"While art by definition must trigger certain emotional responses, occasionally there’s too-obvious a feeling of really being manipulated and stroked. Fact that Rocky gets his big chance from cynical schemers–with a black public hero as the instigator–rests uneasily at moments. Then there are occasional flashes that the film may be patronizing the lower end of the blue-collar mentality, as much if not more than the characters who keep putting Rocky down on the screen. However, Avildsen is noted for creating such ambiguities."
tt0075148,"The story is achingly familiar, and though Stallone has a certain power, he is certainly not the subtlest actor to crawl out from under Marlon's overcoat. But the picture goes most wrong in the conceit it employs to lift Rocky out of the clubs and into the big arena for his title challenge."
tt0075148,"The problem, I think, comes back to Mr. Stallone. Throughout the movie we are asked to believe that his Rocky is compassionate, interesting, even heroic, though the character we see is simply an unconvincing actor imitating a lug."
tt0382932,Brad Bird and Pixar recapture the charm and winning imagination of classic Disney animation.
tt0382932,"Ratatouille is delicious. In this satisfying, souffle-light tale of a plucky French rodent with a passion for cooking, the master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients -- abundant verbal and visual wit, genius slapstick timing, a soupcon of Gallic sophistication -- to produce a warm and irresistible concoction that's sure to appeal to everyone's inner Julia Child."
tt0382932,Bird clearly knows the great silent clowns: The slapstick he devises is balletic.
tt0382932,"Its sense of humor is more sly, more sophisticated and more interesting than most PG-13 or R-rated comedies at the moment. The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human."
tt0382932,"Bird and his co-writers leave room for quiet moments and gentle morals, but for the most part, they send visual gags and verbal punchlines tearing past at an enjoyably demanding speed, whipping up the film's energy at every turn."
tt0382932,Ratatouille is as much a feast for the senses as it is food for thought.
tt0382932,"Pixar's animation is simply flawless; colorful, deeply realized, and ably conveying both the chaos of the kitchen, and the sensual allure of food well prepared."
tt0382932,What makes Ratatouille such a hilarious and heartfelt wonder is the way Bird contrives to let it sneak up on you.
tt0382932,"Ratatouille is a blithe concoction, as well as a miraculously textured piece of animated design."
tt0382932,"For parents looking to spend time in a theater with their kids or adults who want something lighter and less testosterone-oriented than the usual summer fare, Ratatouille offers a savory main course."
tt0091763,"It was Francois Truffaut who said that it's not possible to make an anti-war movie, because all war movies, with their energy and sense of adventure, end up making combat look like fun. If Truffaut had lived to see Platoon, the best film of 1986, he might have wanted to modify his opinion. Here is a movie that regards combat from ground level, from the infantryman's point of view, and it does not make war look like fun."
tt0091763,"Possibly the best work of any kind about the Vietnam War since Michael Herr's vigorous and hallucinatory book ""Dispatches."""
tt0091763,"Platoon is a triumph for Oliver Stone, a film in which a visceral approach to violence, which has always set him apart, is balanced by classical symmetries and a kind of elegiac distance. This is not the Vietnam of op-ed writers, rabble-rousers or esthetic visionaries, not Vietnam-as-metaphor or Vietnam-the-way-it-should-have-been. It is a movie about Vietnam as it was, alive with authenticity, seen through the eyes of a master filmmaker who lost his innocence there."
tt0091763,"[Stone] succeeds with an immediacy that is frightening. War movies of the past, even the greatest ones, seem like crane shots by comparison; Platoon is at ground zero."
tt0091763,"If Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter are like slaps to the face, Platoon is a punch to the gut."
tt0091763,"Stone's eye-blistering images possess an awesome power, which sets the senses reeling and leaves the mind disturbed."
tt0091763,"PLATOON is a shattering experience. Writer-director Stone, a Vietnam veteran, used his first-hand knowledge to create one of the most realistic war films ever made, one whose success lies in the mass of detail Stone brings to the screen, bombarding the senses with vivid sights and sounds that have the feel of actual experience."
tt0091763,"This mercilessly intense movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. The atmosphere remains highly charged from beginning to end. There’s no letup, nary a suggestion of humor to break the tension. The viewer remains as stunned and repelled by the action as the movie’s well-bred narrator, an idealistic young volunteer (played effectively by Charlie Sheen) who naively expects to find himself by sharing the mud with the mostly poor and uneducated grunts."
tt0091763,"A touch too heavy on the Faust scenario, this is nevertheless a typically powerful effort from Stone especially strong on the nightmarish aspects of the war, as when a simple misundertsanding instantly becomes a massacre...Gripping stuff"
tt0091763,"There is plenty of good work to be found here, and pic certainly grabs the viewer by the collar in a way not found everyday in contemporary films."
tt3315342,"Seamlessly melding Marvel mythology with Western mythology, James Mangold has crafted an affectingly stripped-down stand-alone feature, one that draws its strength from Hugh Jackman’s nuanced turn as a reluctant, all but dissipated hero."
tt3315342,"Each time the violence explodes, it’s slashingly satisfying, because it’s earned, and also because Mangold knows just how to stage it."
tt3315342,"Logan is a film for people, like me, who thought the only good bit of X-Men: Apocalypse was Michael Fassbender crying in the woods, and left the cinema wishing that had been the whole thing. It’s something no-one could have expected: a creatively risky superhero movie. And it deserves to pay off."
tt3315342,"In Logan, the clawed mutant Wolverine finally gets to slash through the constraints of a kid-friendly PG-13 rating, and the result is bloody, vicious fun. The squeamish will avert their eyes, and young children should not be allowed anywhere near this movie, no matter how many X-Men action figures they own."
tt3315342,"Logan isn’t always a satisfying movie, but there’s a very satisfying answer to those questions waiting for viewers at the end of it. Satisfying not only because Mangold resolves things with some brilliantly expressive imagery, or because he endows this story with a no-shits-left-to-give honesty that defies its origins and justifies its spectacular violence and salty vocabulary, but because it proves how iconic Jackman has made this character over the last 17 years."
tt3315342,"A movie with the bleakest vision of Wolverine yet, but also hands down the best treatment the character has received on the big screen in the fifteen plus years Jackman has inhabited the role."
tt3315342,Whether or not the “Wolverine” movies have a future — Jackman swears this is his last go-round — Logan is an exceedingly entertaining one.
tt3315342,"The loner has to learn to put someone else first. It’s both as manipulative and hokey as that sounds, but occasionally it works well enough that you might find yourself getting choked up against your better judgment."
tt3315342,It recognizes that the thinly veiled secret of Wolverine’s loner act is that he’s always been a cog of some kind.
tt3315342,"The picture is mostly tedious and unpleasant, which is a shame for the sake of the performers. Jackman works hard here, and his performance does away with vanity altogether."
tt1895587,"Like any creative endeavor a film is the sum of its parts. In the most elementary terms it needs a screenplay as a base, a cast to bring the script to life and a director to orchestrate the pieces into something of considerable impact. Excuse the hyperbole, but Tom McCarthy's Spotlight is an example of when all those pieces fit together almost perfectly."
tt1895587,"It’s a more subtle, damning film for implicating the media – as much as the church, the courts, the legal profession and other Boston institutions – in the systematic, wider cultural cover-up it describes."
tt1895587,"Spotlight is that rare journalistic procedural that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as “All the President’s Men,” and while the movie never glamorizes or makes saints of its hard-working newsgatherers, it does stand as a reminder of the power and importance of a free press, particularly in ferreting out local corruption and malfeasance."
tt1895587,"It's the best film McCarthy has ever made: restrained, intelligent and grown-up, but unfolding with the pacing and rhythm of a thriller."
tt1895587,"Like so many films consumed with the minutiae of daily journalism, Spotlight is a magnificently nerdy process movie — a tour de force of filing-cabinet cinema, made with absolute assurance that we’ll be held by scene after scene of people talking, taking notes, following tips, hounding sources, poring over records, filling out spreadsheets, and having one door after another slammed in their faces."
tt1895587,"There’s no tidy moral to take away, because a story like this shouldn’t end in comfort. Instead, your skin’s left prickling by its deft deconstruction of the business of secret-keeping, and its perceptive setting out of the courage and diligence it takes to overturn it."
tt1895587,"The overly earnest movie falls below the rich ambiguities that Keaton brings to the part, resulting in a measured drama so restrained it sometimes underserves the material. Where ""Birdman"" magnified Keaton's talent, Spotlight leans on it."
tt1895587,"A polished, engrossing procedural, Spotlight offers plenty of old-fashioned pleasures — chiefly, the sight of smart, scrappy muckraking journalists stopping at nothing to uncover systematic corruption."
tt1895587,"Spotlight never hits the heights of passion, but capably and decently tells an important story."
tt1895587,"This material cant help but be interesting, even compelling up to a point, but its prosaic presentation suggests that the story's full potential, encompassing deep, disturbing and enduring pain on all sides of the issue, has only begun to be touched."
tt0088247,Director James Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd (both of whom co-wrote the script) demonstrate their storytelling virtuosity.
tt0088247,"A blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story."
tt0088247,"The movie's scares are intense, but the notion that the Terminator would move on to politics is even more frightening."
tt0088247,"Kineticism and suspense, combined with strongly conceived characters....Made Cameron a talent to watch. [13 Jan 1995, p. 67]"
tt0088247,"Plenty of tech-noir savvy to keep infidels and action fans satisfied.[26 Nov 1984, p. 105]"
tt0088247,"A model of economic storytelling....It raised the bar for movie action to a bionic level. [1 Dec 2003, p.13]"
tt0088247,An amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget.
tt0088247,"An efficient, cold-blooded sci-fi splatter movie that never makes the mistake of forgetting that on some level it is deeply ridiculous."
tt0088247,"Schwarzenegger is presented as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength--the image is more geological than human--and Cameron plays his crushing weightiness against the strangely light, almost graceful violence of the gunplay directed against him. The results have the air of a demented ballet."
tt0088247,A B-movie with flair.
tt0092005,"The entire cast is superb and it so perfectly paced, that the story unfolds with wit, pathos and sensitivity and completely free of emotional shortcuts."
tt0092005,"Stand By Me is the summer's great gift, a compassionate, perfectly performed look at the real heart of youth. It stands, sweet and strong, ribald, outrageous and funny, like its heroes themselves--a bit gamy around the edges, perhaps, but pure and fine clear through. It's one of those treasures absolutely not to be missed."
tt0092005,"Stand By Me is one of those films that stands up to the test of time. It may never top any critic’s “films of the century” list, like Citizen Kane, or Raging Bull, but it has a charm and depth that seems to resonate with each generation."
tt0092005,"The Ben E King theme song and all the imagery of tousled adolescents preening themselves like miniature James Deans rekindle memories of old jeans commercials, but the film is so well-observed and so energetically acted by its young cast that mawkishness is kept at bay."
tt0092005,"The richness of its tapestry, densely woven from human emotions and character interaction, ensure it will never lose that relevance."
tt0092005,"Rob Reiner’s film is all about the journey, not the destination. And all of his young actors are great — Wheaton as the sensitive narrator, Feldman as the slightly crazy wild card, and especially Phoenix as the tough-yet-tender doomed soul."
tt0092005,Stand By Me is a shuck. It trumpets its sensitivity while reveling in coarseness. And at its climax it suggests that manhood can be found through the barrel of a gun. Maybe this is how Rambo discovered puberty. Maybe real kids should be discouraged from following his example.
tt0092005,Stand by Me is easily one of the best Stephen King adaptations and one of the best coming-of-age stories ever made.
tt0092005,"A sentimental film that works because of its unsentimental moments--in particular, its sometimes embarassingly honest portrayal of what interests boys and how they talk about it. Reiner elicits some excellent performances from his young cast (River Phoenix is a standout) and Kiefer Sutherland is memorable as a menacing teen hood."
tt0092005,"Some of their horsing around, 1950ish style, is comical, but too much of what they do is only too plainly imposed by the movie makers. Rob Reiner's direction hammers in every obvious element in an obvious script."
tt1979320,"Utterly gripping. Aided by two punchy lead turns, an Oscar-worthy script and stunning in-car footage, Howard’s race film delivers top-gear drama. A piston- and heart-pumping triumph."
tt1979320,"Not just one of the great racing movies of all time, but a virtuoso feat of filmmaking in its own right, elevated by two of the year’s most compelling performances."
tt1979320,Rush is one of those rare sports movies that’s compelling as both a drama and a spectacle.
tt1979320,"Rush is a pretty thrilling piece of pop entertainment. It's excitingly assembled and moves like a bullet, highly engaging and nerve-wracking when it needs to be and light on its feet elsewhere."
tt1979320,"Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl excel as, respectively, British wild man and hedonist James Hunt and Austrian by-the-books tactician Niki Lauda."
tt1979320,"Rush has sex, glamour, a fair degree of wit and a breathless, pedal-to-the-metal spirit. But its greatest achievement may be to underline that there are real men, all vulnerable flesh and blood, inside those infernal machines."
tt1979320,"It rarely deviates from formula, but Rush wins big, delivering the most exciting F1 footage created for film. Like Hunt, it is sexy, funny, full of thrills. Like Lauda, it is intelligent, a bit blunt, but ultimately touching."
tt1979320,"What Rush has to offer is a great human drama, two dangerously talented men pushing each other to risky victory and a superb script, delivered with some mastery by Hemsworth and Brühl."
tt1979320,"Rush is fast, slippery, stormy and dangerous."
tt1979320,"Rush hits a few potholes, but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when they're cheating death."
tt0074958,"So the movie's flawed. So it leaves us with loose ends and questions. That finally doesn't bother me, because what it does accomplish is done so well, is seen so sharply, is presented so unforgivingly, that Network will outlive a lot of tidier movies."
tt0074958,Sidney Lumet’s direction is outstanding.
tt0074958,Network is typical of the cool intelligence of '70s American cinema.
tt0074958,"Whatever its flaws, Network is a picture that can stand on its own. And does."
tt0074958,"Network can be faulted both for going too far and not far enough, but it's also something that very few commercial films are these days. It's alive. This, I suspect, is the Lumet drive. It's also the wit of performers like Mr. Finch, Mr. Holden, and Miss Dunaway."
tt0074958,"It's a dark, dark comedy that ruthlessly skewers the news industry on a stake, then roasts it alive."
tt0074958,"There's an amazing display of acting talent, even though director Lumet doesn't quite tie all the strands together."
tt0074958,"The film is immaculately cast...The principal figures in its ideological debate – the chilly, number-crunching executive Robert Duvall, godlike network supremo Ned Beatty and the ambitious, exploitative programmer Faye Dunaway – are vivid caricatures. But the movie runs out of steam as satiric invention turns into fervent, deeply sincere statement, and solid William Holden’s middle-aged producer becomes the representative of old-fashioned integrity."
tt0074958,"There is a lunatic energy about it. Every once in a while, Chayefsky abandons the struggle to dramatize his ideas and has somebody, usually Holden, just turn to the camera and spout off. In those moments, his concern — and sometimes his mother wit — comes blazing through and the picture takes on a life not found in safe, sane, well-calculated movies."
tt0074958,"He hardly bothers with the characters; the movie is a ventriloquial harrangue. He thrashes around in messianic God-love booziness, driving each scene to an emotional peak."
tt0381681,This is one of the most wildly romantic movies in ages.
tt0381681,"Summer sequelitis is upon us, but the season is unlikely to bring anything more remarkable than Richard Linklater's sweet, smart, and deeply romantic Before Sunset."
tt0381681,"Yep, this movie is basically a yakfest, but an incredibly fluid and involving one, and if you have any kind of affinity for either of the characters, you&#146;re bound to find the picture a kind of miracle."
tt0381681,"The new film, which unfolds in real time over the course of 80 minutes, is a deeper, darker, altogether more memorable experience. It doesn't extend the characters so much as fulfill them."
tt0381681,The movie is an O. Henry-like conceit--the slenderness of the initial premise is part of the charm--but the anecdote becomes almost momentous as it goes on.
tt0381681,"In the spirit of the original, Linklater closes with one of the best endings of its kind since George Romero's ""Martin."""
tt0381681,"In the midst of summer's cinematic thunder and lightning, this is a rare moment of tranquility."
tt0381681,The sequel is an uninterrupted 80-minute dialogue between two richly imagined and performed characters.
tt0381681,A savvy sequel that should speak to anyone who's let that one great love slip away.
tt0381681,"There is something uniquely unforgettable in the way Linklater, Hawke and Delpy (equal collaborators on the script) find nuance, art and eroticism in words, spoken and unspoken. The actors shine."
tt0032138,"Not only is it wonderfully entertaining, but the issues it addresses, and the way it presents them, are both universal and deeply personal. And therein lies The Wizard of Oz's true magic."
tt0032138,"This wonderful romp of a movie looks magical on the big screen: colors are a picnic for the eyes, details loom so clearly you can practically touch them and there's a sense of the larger-than-life with a film that's already larger than life."
tt0032138,This is one vintage film that fully lives up to its classic status and should play with outstanding success to contemporary audiences of all ages.
tt0032138,"The Wizard of Oz remains the weirdest, scariest, kookiest, most haunting and indelible kid-flick-that's-really-for-adults ever made in Hollywood."
tt0032138,"Each time it is shown, this extraordinary film embraces a new generation of children who succumb to its magic."
tt0032138,"The Wizard of Oz has a wonderful surface of comedy and music, special effects and excitement, but we still watch it six decades later because its underlying story penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of childhood, stirs them and then reassures them."
tt0032138,"Despite its earnest endorsement of the idea that there's no place like home ... well, frankly there are plenty of places like boring old home, but nothing's like Oz."
tt0032138,Judy Garland is perfectly cast as Dorothy. She is as clever a little actress as she is a singer and her special style of vocalizing is ideally adapted to the music of the picture.
tt0032138,A delightful piece of wonder-working which had the youngsters' eyes shining and brought a quietly amused gleam to the wiser ones of the oldsters.
tt0032138,"Fantasy is still Walt Disney’s undisputed domain. Nobody else can tell a fairy tale with his clarity of imagination, his simple good taste, or his technical ingenuity. This was forcibly borne in on me as I sat cringing before M-G-M’s Technicolor production of The Wizard of Oz, which displays no trace of imagination, good taste, or ingenuity."
tt0758758,"The beauty of Into the Wild, which Penn has written and directed with magnificent precision and imaginative grace, is that what Christopher is running from is never as important as what he's running TO."
tt0758758,There's a bittersweet quality to McCandless' story that Penn captures intuitively.
tt0758758,"To these eyes, Into the Wild is an unusually soulful and poetic movie that crystallizes McCandless in all his glittering enigma, and allows us to decide for ourselves whether he was the spiritual son of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and John Muir, or the boy most likely to become Theodore Kaczynski."
tt0758758,"Into the Wild is a beautifully made motion picture and some of the segments (especially those with Hal Holbrook and those that transpire around ""the magic bus"" in Alaska) are powerful."
tt0758758,"Penn, in tandem with the superb cinematographer Eric Gautier (The Motorcycle Diaries), captures the majesty and terror of the wilderness in ways that make you catch your breath."
tt0758758,"Though the film’s structure may be tragic, its spirit is anything but."
tt0758758,"From seductive start to shattering finish, the film is as stirring, entertaining and steadfastly thrilling as it is beautiful."
tt0758758,"Penn has a real feeling for the stray moments in life that suddenly rush up and overwhelm us with emotion. He also has an eye for beauty in the wilds, of which this film has many. And he's very good with actors. What he lacks is a sharper eye for the wooziness of romanticism, and that wooziness, despite some truly breathtaking moments, infuses Into the Wild."
tt0758758,"Sean Penn delivers a compelling, ambitious work that will satisfy most admirers of the book."
tt0758758,"With all the narration and fits of slow motion, the movie seems like the work of a nervous chain-smoker. It lacks concentration--and with it, the potential for rapture."
tt0036868,"It feels surprisingly modern: lean, direct, honest about issues that Hollywood then studiously avoided. After the war years of patriotism and heroism in the movies, this was a sobering look at the problems veterans faced when they returned home."
tt0036868,It is seldom that there comes a motion picture which can be wholly and enthusiastically endorsed not only as superlative entertainment but as food for quiet and humanizing thought.
tt0036868,One of the best pictures of our lives.
tt0036868,"The Best Years of Our Lives runs almost three hours, but it doesn't seem nearly that long. The film is so involving that there's no temptation to glance at a watch, nor a need to get a snack or take a bathroom break. In fact, when it's over, there's almost a sense of disappointment that there aren't a few scenes left hiding on the other side of the closing credits. The feeling of warmth and satisfaction that accompanies the conclusion is the hallmark of a great drama - a distinction that anyone who has seen The Best Years of Our Lives will apply to this landmark production."
tt0036868,"The best coming home movie ever made. ""I don't care if it doesn't make a nickel,"" Sam Goldwyn reportedly said of THE BEST YEARS, ""I just want every man, woman, and child in America to see it."""
tt0036868,"It’s not the whole story, of course; it’s resolutely on the side of decorum and falls far short of the inner and outer postwar apocalypses envisioned in film noir. But the intensity of its liberal romanticism is utterly gripping."
tt0036868,"Unlike most sure-fire movies, it was put together with good taste, honesty, wit—and even a strong suggestion of guts."
tt0036868,"If The Best Years of Our Lives emerges as a more contemporary-seeing film than almost anything else to which its ingredients could compare, it’s because of how it wrestles with the burden of patriotism. The nation’s problems are right there in plain sight, just as clear as cinematographer Gregg Toland’s typically precise deep-focus shots."
tt0036868,"This is intelligent, admirably unsentimental and utterly involving for its full three-hour running time."
tt0036868,"The movie does have an air of cautiousness about it, trying so hard to be a respectful, definitive statement on WWII (and often succeeding) that it sometimes feels cadaverous."
tt0070047,"Rarely do movies affect us so deeply. The first time I saw Cries and Whispers, I found myself shrinking down in my seat, somehow trying to escape from the implications of Bergman’s story. The Exorcist also has that effect--but we’re not escaping from Friedkin’s implications, we’re shrinking back from the direct emotional experience he’s attacking us with. This movie doesn’t rest on the screen; it’s a frontal assault."
tt0070047,"This jolting tale of a 12-year-old girl possessed by the devil, her desperate movie actress mother and the two priests called in to exorcise the demon, actually seems a deeper movie now -- more intense, less formulaic or shallow. Yet it's also retained all its original hypnotic narrative grip. [2000 re-release]"
tt0070047,"There's something elemental about The Exorcist, even with the new hopeful ending that betrays the bleak original. [2000 re-release]"
tt0070047,"Here, in paranoid, bad acid trip form, is the real birth of girl power. [2000 re-release]"
tt0070047,"Director William Friedkin, (“The French Connection” and this year’s “Rules of Engagement”) has always been a provocateur, a master of the shock. But his very lack of subtlety is both the strength and weakness of The Exorcist in the 21st century. [2000 re-release]"
tt0070047,"Just as some of the footage deepens what is already there, additions in final reel, though closer to Blatty’s wishes, restate the obvious or add a feel-good patina which pushes the film closer to our own audience-pleasing period than the more daring early ’70s. [2000 re-release]"
tt0070047,"A museum piece, something to be enjoyed for its historical value. [2000 re-release]"
tt0070047,"The Exorcist is still shocking, but mostly because of its graphic, anti-religious language. [2000 re-release]"
tt0070047,"In both its original 1973 version and its expanded 2000 edition, this hugely popular horror yarn is less a cleverly spun story than a disjointed collection of shockeroos, surrounding a few ghoulishly effective moments with overcooked plot twists and in-your-face vulgarity. [2000 re-release]"
tt0070047,"11 minutes longer than the original, and 11 minutes worse. [2000 re-release]"
tt0107048,"For once, the audience isn't forced to surrender its intelligence (or its healthy cynicism) to embrace the film's sunny resolution."
tt0107048,A hilarious and unexpectedly profound comedy.
tt0107048,"This movie has all the qualities necessary to be a crowd-pleaser: likable characters, charismatic performers, a strong, capably-executed premise, and lots of laughs."
tt0107048,"Murray, more often than not, is pretty unbearable; but here, playing a man who is unbearable, Murray begins convincingly, amusingly, and gets even more amusing as he metamorphoses. [15 Mar 1993, p.24]"
tt0107048,"That glimmer of recognition is what makes Groundhog Day a particularly witty and resonant comedy, even when its jokes are more apt to prompt gentle giggles than rolling in the aisles."
tt0107048,A demonstration of the way time can sometimes give us a break.
tt0107048,There were a lot of ways for this film to go stupid; it succumbs to none of them.
tt0107048,"The funniest moments in Groundhog Day come when Phil takes sneaky advantage of his predicament-by, say, pumping a sexy woman in the local coffee shop for facts about her past and then, ''the next day,'' using the information to lure her into bed. What the movie lacks is the ingenious, lapidary comic structure that could have made these moments fuse into something tricky and wild."
tt0107048,"Dial your expectations to moderate, burrow in for the duration, and you won't be disappointed - it ain't exactly springtime, but there are worse things than an amiable outing on a winter's night."
tt0107048,"Considering that none of the characters is fresh or interesting, it's a commendable achievement that the quality of the storytelling alone keeps the movie watchable and likable."
tt0317705,Pixar again hitches top-notch storytelling to the very best in CG animation.
tt0317705,"The sleek beauty, crafty wit, family warmth, and impeccable slapstick suffusing The Incredibles immediately vaults it to a new, higher level of entertainment."
tt0317705,"As deliriously smart escapist fare, The Incredibles is practically nonpareil."
tt0317705,"Dazzlingly beautiful, funny, and meaningful."
tt0317705,The Incredibles creates so seamless a mood of exhilaration that we resent being pulled out of it.
tt0317705,"The Incredibles has those characters, that heart."
tt0317705,"The vocal performances are a blast, Hunter's and Lee's in particular. The animation of the villain's tropical isle is stunning."
tt0317705,"Yes, yes--The Incredibles is beautiful to look at, but even more lovely beneath the computer-generated surfaces."
tt0317705,"The action sequences are choreographed with the crackerjack timing expected from Pixar, but the film's funniest and most affecting moments exploit the tension between a special family and a world that insists on dulling them down."
tt0317705,"Unfortunately, the delicious snatches of reflexive wit function as mere intermissions between the distended action sequences and Michael Bay&#150;style megatonnage, which have earned Pixar its first ever PG rating."
tt0035446,"To Be Or Not To Be works as both comedy and thriller, ratcheting up the tension and humor as the actors’ scheme threatens to fall apart, and the gags build on one another."
tt0035446,"One of Hollywood’s funniest, and most poignant, classics."
tt0035446,"It could be [Lubitsch's] finest achievement, and it's certainly one of the most profound, emotionally complex comedies ever made, covering a range of tones from satire to slapstick to shocking black humor."
tt0035446,"To Be or Not to Be, co-starring Carole Lombard and Jack Benny, under expert guidance of Ernst Lubitsch, is absorbing drama with farcical trimmings. It's an acting triumph for Lombard, who delivers an effortless and highly effective performance that provides memorable finale to her brilliant screen career."
tt0035446,"Many of the film’s pleasures, then, derive from watching these characters successfully use the tools of the stage (improvisation, sense memory, prosthetics) to successfully subvert the Nazis."
tt0035446,[A] magnificent film.
tt0035446,"The picture, produced by Alexander Korda, under Lubitsch's direction, has some deliciously funny moments and every now and then a serious sequence is injected that startles the audience into an attitude of taut suspense. But it seems to me that the background of the Melchior Lenggel story is a bit too grim for joking."
tt0035446,"Because the second half of To Be Or Not To Be, once Benny starts impersonating Nazis, is so outlandishly hilarious, it’s easy to forgive the film’s comparatively sluggish first half, which is mostly setup for gags to come."
tt0035446,"Ernst Lubitsch, who directed, starts off on the wrong foot and never gets his balance; the performers yowl their lines, and the burlesque of the Nazis, who cower before their superior officers, is more crudely gleeful than funny."
tt0035446,"In a spirit of levity, contused by frequent doses of shock, Mr. Lubitsch has set his actors to performing a spy-thriller of fantastic design amid the ruins and frightful oppressions of Nazi-in-vaded Warsaw. To say it is callous and macabre is understating the case."
tt0325980,"Finally, there's a big-budget popcorn movie that delivers what moviegoers hunger for: humor, action, thrills and charismatic characters. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the summer blockbuster we've been waiting for."
tt0325980,"A film that dares to be smart, reasonably complicated and scary while swashing its buckles."
tt0325980,Verbinski puts a Jackie Chan flourish of high energy and gymnastic action on the swashbuckling stunts and swordplay and keeps this lark sailing along.
tt0325980,"Pirates offers something for everyone: Bloom and Depp for the ladies, big action and Knightley for the men, self-aware gags for the postmodern crowd, Depp and Rush for fans of top-rank scenery chewing."
tt0325980,"Letting any other actor run wild like this could have been a disaster, but Depp's peculiar buccaneer is an instant classic of actorly charisma."
tt0325980,Convoluted but diverting.
tt0325980,"Trimming half an hour from this bloated, 143-minute blockbuster would have highlighted the film's treasures, not the least of which is Johnny Depp's endearingly eccentric performance as Captain Jack Sparrow."
tt0325980,"Director Gore Verbiniski delivers the best one can hope for: a cleverly nostalgic, high-tech copy of the real deal."
tt0325980,"Depp swans through this swashbuckler with a scene-stealing gusto unseen since Marlon Brando in ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" He's comic dynamite, but this plodding, repetitive bore should walk the plank for timidly refusing to light his fuse."
tt0325980,The booty here is 100 percent fool's gold.
tt0032551,"The message is boldly displayed, but told with characters of such sympathy and images of such beauty that audiences leave the theater feeling more pity than anger or resolve. It's a message movie, but not a recruiting poster."
tt0032551,"Gregg Toland captures the open spaces and big skies of rural America, while the normally conservative Ford puts forward a sympathetic but radical plea for workers' rights and freedom for the people."
tt0032551,"Too many films these days trivialize poverty as an ironically, tastelessly over-produced pageant to earn kudos. The Grapes of Wrath is flawed, but it captures that shiver of panic that grips anyone for whom the money for the next meal is unknown. The film remains a vital document of the perversion and torment of the fantasy most commonly known as the American Dream."
tt0032551,"It is an absorbing, tense melodrama, starkly realistic, and loaded with social and political fireworks."
tt0032551,"In the vast library where the celluloid literature of the screen is stored there is one small, uncrowded shelf devoted to the cinema's masterworks, to those films which by dignity of theme and excellence of treatment seem to be of enduring artistry, seem destined to be recalled not merely at the end of their particular year but whenever great motion pictures are mentioned. To that shelf of screen classics Twentieth Century-Fox yesterday added its version of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath."
tt0032551,"The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book. It is certainly the best picture Darryl F. Zanuck has produced or Nunnally Johnson scripted. It would be the best John Ford had directed if he had not already made ""The Informer."""
tt0032551,"The word that comes in most handily for The Grapes of Wrath is magnificent. Movies will probably go on improving and broadening themselves; but in any event, The Grapes of Wrath is the most mature picture story that has ever been made, in feeling, in purpose, and in the use of the medium. You can drag out classics (it is often safer not to go back and see them) and you can roll off names in different tongues and times. But this is a best that has no very near comparison to date."
tt0032551,Ford's visualization of Steinbeck's novel is so emotionally gripping that viewers have little time to collect themselves from one powerful scene to the next.
tt0032551,"Ford's film, shot by Gregg Toland with magnificent, lyrical simplicity, captures the stark plainness of the migrants, stripped to a few possessions, left with innumerable relations and little hope."
tt0032551,"Ford's admirers have rightly tended to play this down in favor of his later and more personal westerns, but there's much to admire here in Gregg Toland's sun-beaten photography and Henry Fonda's meticulous performance as Steinbeck's dashboard saint, Tom Joad."
tt0058946,"A prototype of news-footage realism, the film makes shrewd use of handheld sloppiness, misjudged focus, overexposure, and you-are-there camera upset; the payoff is the scent of authentic panic."
tt0058946,"Like all masterpieces, it speaks to later ages as powerfully and intelligently as to its own."
tt0058946,"Achieves its success through a combination of attitude and technique, uniting, to exceptional effect, a way of viewing the world morally while looking at it physically."
tt0058946,"It's one of the best movies about revolutionary and anticolonial activism ever made, convincing, balanced, passionate, and compulsively watchable as storytelling."
tt0058946,"Nearly four decades ago, Pontecorvo anatomized the very form of modern terrorist warfare: the hidden cells, the cultish leaders, the brutish cycle of attack and counterattack."
tt0058946,"What reveals Pontecorvo as an artist, and not simply a propagandist of genius, is the sorrow he tries to stifle but that comes flooding through anyway--the sense that ALL sides in this conflict have lost their souls, and that all men are carrion."
tt0058946,"A classic of politically engaged filmmaking, based on a book by Saadi Yacef, a former FLN leader who also produced the picture and played a version of himself."
tt0058946,The greatness of The Battle of Algiers lies in its ability to embrace moral ambiguity without succumbing to it.
tt0058946,"What makes the movie's power creditable is Pontecorvo's ability to present combatants on both sides as multidimensional, nonheroic human beings, even though it's obvious where the director's own sentiments lie. (Review of original release)"
tt0058946,It's a dedicated effort with importance as a 'document.' (Review of original release)
tt0245712,"A stunner: a fiercely brilliant film of such wrenching impact, nonstop drive and unpredictability that watching it becomes an exhilarating ride."
tt0245712,"Fierce, loving, and electric, this movie's got bite as well as bark."
tt0245712,An overpowering and original piece of bravura filmmaking that constitutes one of the most breathtaking and impressive directing debuts in years.
tt0245712,The most enthralling movie of the year.
tt0245712,"The gritty, Oscar-nominated ""Traffic"" is a limo ride compared with the bloodletting in this year's foreign-film nominee from Mexico."
tt0245712,"As bloody as any recent film. But it's shot through with a harsh, stony humor that's invigorating enough to be regarded as a slap back at death."
tt0245712,"A feverish, breathtaking tour through Mexico City high and low, an explosive, mosaic-style portrait of our continent's largest city."
tt0245712,He (Gonzalez Inarritu) handles a complex plot with clarity and precision while keeping audience members on the edge of their seats.
tt0245712,"There's something overly studied, almost clinical, in how it all pulls together."
tt0245712,"Undeniably high-powered. At 153 minutes, it's also punishingly overlong."
tt0032976,"The suspense of the story is magnificently sustained throughout the film, which didn't surprise us, as maintaining suspense in a story has always been Director Hitchcock's forte"
tt0032976,A key film in Alfred Hitchcock’s evolution as a master explorer of sexual neuroses.
tt0032976,"An altogether brilliant film, haunting, suspenseful, handsome and handsomely played."
tt0032976,"The performances are first-rate, and Anderson as the obsessively attached maid Mrs. Danvers is a perverse gem."
tt0032976,"With Rebecca, he (Hitchcock) illustrates an aptitude for crafting not only psychological terror but drama and romance."
tt0032976,"Picture is noteworthy in its literal translation of Daphne du Maurier’s novel to the screen, presenting all of the sombreness and dramatic tragedy of the book in its unfolding. More important, it commands attention in establishing Joan Fontaine as a potential screen personality of upper brackets."
tt0032976,"Produced by David Selznick, Rebecca is a delirious Gothic melodrama, swimming with queer undercurrents"
tt0032976,"Through its first two-thirds it is as perfect a myth of adolescence as any of the Disney films, documenting the childlike, nameless heroine's initiation into the adult mysteries of sex, death, and identity, and the impossibility of reconciling these forces with family strictures."
tt0032976,"In its essence, Rebecca is another entry in the Wuthering Heights school of dour, somber, psychological drama, steeped in ultra-British atmosphere. Though overlong, it is beautifully done."
tt0032976,"Somewhat tonally inconsistent; following the social comedy of Monte Carlo and suspense of Manderley, the pace slackens in the crime procedural of the final half-hour, which is all tell and no show. Still, Hitchcock shows superb technical control and attends to his trademark motifs, from monstrous mother figures to the fetishisation of clothing (strong foreshadowings of ‘Vertigo’)."
tt4016934,"Expectations are fully met in Park Chan-wook’s exquisitely filmed The Handmaiden (Agassi), an amusingly kinky erotic thriller and love story that brims with delicious surprises, making its two-and-a-half hours fly by."
tt4016934,"No matter its overarching ridiculousness, The Handmaiden remains a hugely enjoyable dose of grotesque escapism from a master of the form."
tt4016934,"An intensely pleasurable, lavishly shot dessert tray of utter hokum, The Handmaiden is a prime example of why we should be glad that there’s someone out there still invested in the overwrought Gothic melodrama, and that that person is Park Chan-wook."
tt4016934,"By replacing the class system of Victorian England with the dynamic of the occupier and occupied, Park has tapped into something uniquely complex about a chapter of history that is rarely explored. There is a deep, festering malady at the heart of The Handmaiden, exacerbated by idle fantasy, cultural projection and denial."
tt4016934,"The film reveals its twists and turns with a delicate hand and always manages to stay one step ahead of the audience, even as most of those watching will surrender to the hypnotic erotic charge that runs through the film."
tt4016934,"Given the nudity on show, some are already quick to criticise Park’s direction as gratuitous and to claim that his male gaze is affecting the depiction of lesbian romance. But the impotency of the male characters helps to counter this while the sex scenes themselves, as lovingly shot as they might be, feel vital to the narrative."
tt4016934,"The film manages the tricky feat of both staying true to Waters breathless, page-turning prose, and creating a wholly persuasive new milieu for the story."
tt4016934,"It’s sybaritic, cruel and luridly mesmerizing."
tt4016934,"Those familiar with Park’s earlier work will know that he’s hardly the most subtle of filmmakers, and his approach to gender politics here is risible, even self-contradictory. His customary prowess as a stylist and knack for constructing and navigating intricate plots, on the other hand, is once again put to good use."
tt4016934,"It’s hard to pinpoint the precise moment at which The Handmaiden, Park Chan-wook’s deviously kinky period thriller, shifts from being a lascivious slice of art-house delirium to a gruelling, dislikable contraption which meretriciously sells out its source material. But that’s what happens."
tt0061512,"Luke is the first Newman character to understand himself well enough to tell us to shove off. He's through risking his neck to make us happy. With this film, Newman completes a cycle of five films over six years, and together they have something to say about the current status of heroism. But Cool Hand Luke does draw together threads from the earlier movies, especially Hombre, and it is a tough, honest film with backbone."
tt0061512,"Paul Newman gives one of his best performances in this prison film, where he inspires life in to his fellow inmates. Has something important to say with several memorable moments and a superb supporting cast."
tt0061512,"Mr. Newman is excellent, at the top of his sometime erratic form, in the role of this warped and alienated loner whose destiny it is to lose. George Kennedy is powerfully obsessive as the top-dog who handles things his way as effectively and finally as destructively as does the warden or the guards."
tt0061512,"Too cool for words, then switches past midstream into a work of poignancy and power."
tt0061512,"One of the sharpest prison dramas ever, although it's graced with some very humorous portions as well."
tt0061512,"Newman gives an excellent performance, assisted by a terrific supporting cast, including George Kennedy, outstanding as the unofficial leader of the cons who yields first place to Newman."
tt0061512,"Cool Hand Luke is a metaphor for the social climate in which it germinated. Luke represents that segment of the population who will not submit, no matter how viciously they are beaten. They repeatedly rise up, convinced not only of the rightness of their actions, but that, in the end, they can make a difference. In the midst of the burgeoning '60s cultural revolution, it's impossible to ignore."
tt0061512,"A caustically witty look at the American South and its still-surviving chain gangs, with Newman in fine sardonic form as the boss-baiter who refuses to submit and becomes a hero to his fellow-prisoners. Underlying the hard-bitten surface is a slightly uncomfortable allegory which identifies Newman as a Christ figure. But this scarcely detracts from the brilliantly idiosyncratic script (by Donn Pearce from his own novel) or from Conrad Hall's glittering camerawork (which survives Rosenberg's penchant for the zoom lens and shots reflected in sun-glasses)."
tt0061512,"Paul Newman tells 'em where to get off in this slick, popular antiestablishment drama set in a prison camp. Stuart Rosenberg's direction is a horror, but the cast teems with so many familiar faces that this film can't help but entertain."
tt0061512,"Newman remains watchable and glamorous throughout, bloody, muddy or coated in torso-flattering sweat, but the film’s efforts to sentimentally humanize him by psychological revelation are clumsy."
tt0059742,"As for Andrews, she is just a joy, conveying enough doubt beneath that brisk, clean exterior to stop her character becoming a prig; her comic timing and the way in which she convinces in her relationships with the children are so understated they can be underrated."
tt0059742,"The Robert Wise production is a warmly pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast headed by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer which must strike a respondent chord at the box office."
tt0059742,"The 20th-Fox release will be one of the movies' all-time hits, one of the all-time great pictures. It restores your faith in movies. If you sit quietly and let it take, it may also restore your faith in humanity. It does this with infectious wit, with consistent gaiety, with simple and realistic spirituality, with romance of heartbreak and heartmend. This is set against the most beautiful scenery you have seen in your life. The Sound of Music is quite a picture."
tt0059742,One of the greatest screen musicals ever.
tt0059742,"Robert Wise has transformed the delightful Rodgers and Hammerstein musical stage production of ""The Sound of Music"" into a magical film in which Julie Andrews gives an endearing performance in the role of Maria, the governess."
tt0059742,"Robert Wise's adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical still has a little soul in its bones, with its reactionary nature tempered by Ernest Lehman's supple screenplay, and its elephantine running-time eased by a set of songs that lodge in your system like hookworms."
tt0059742,"It's so perfectly contrived and mechanical and fresh as a daisy, it's infuriating."
tt0059742,"Miss Andrews, with her air of radiant vigor, her appearance of plain-Jane wholesomeness and her ability to make her dialogue as vivid and appealing as she makes her songs, brings a nice sort of Mary Poppins logic and authority to this role, which is always in peril of collapsing under its weight of romantic nonsense and sentiment."
tt0059742,"Though Director Robert Wise (West Side Story) has made capital of the show's virtues, he can do little to disguise its faults. In dialogue, song and story, Music still contains too much sugar, too little spice."
tt0059742,"This 1965 hit is the sort of film that reeks of emotional Muzak, the most elemental responses programmed right into the scenario. Every audience sniffle and tear has been taken into account."
tt0025316,"It’s every goddamn romantic comedy you’ve ever seen. They can all be traced back here, virtually without exception, for eight straight decades now. Technically, the film has never been remade, but that’s largely because, in spirit, it has never stopped being remade. Something so perfectly structured can support nearly endless variations. It’s timeless."
tt0025316,"As buoyant and elegant as bubbles in a glass of champagne, Frank Capra's sublime 1934 comedy, written by long-time collaborator Robert Riskin, survives triumphantly because of its wit, charm, romantic idealism and its shrewd sketch of married life."
tt0025316,A must see.
tt0025316,"For a low-budget production of the early sound era — 1934, seven years after ""The Jazz Singer"" — It Happened One Night has a wide-open quality that’s miraculous under the circumstances. This comes through in Capra’s technique, like a long tracking shot that follows Ellie’s humiliating trek to a public shower, but it really shows in the film’s ambition to be about more than this one love story."
tt0025316,"One of those stories that without a particularly strong plot manages to come through in a big way, due to the acting, dialog, situations and direction. In other words, the story has that intangible quality of charm which arises from a smooth blending of the various ingredients. Difficult to analyze, impossible to designedly reproduce. Just a happy accident."
tt0025316,"Even now, It Happened One Night carries the unmistakable tenor of a breakout hit, fueled by confidently zippy repartee and manic comic invention that almost none of the innumerable pretenders to the throne of romantic comedy can match."
tt0025316,"Nothing can take away from the strength of Gable and Colbert's performances, the illusion of romance in their interaction, and Capra's deftness in crafting this kind of feel-good narrative. The screwball comedy elements work as effectively as the love story, which is a rarity for romantic comedies."
tt0025316,"It Happened One Night is a good piece of fiction, which, with all its feverish stunts, is blessed with bright dialogue and a good quota of relatively restrained scenes."
tt0025316,It Happened One Night is pure delight.
tt0025316,"The direction is excellent. Frank Capra never lets his picture lag for a moment. It is never very exciting, but it moves along snappily and it is full of amusing situations."
tt0060827,"It explores two of the filmmaker’s pet themes – the impossibility of true communication, the futility of art – and is set against the Vietnam War. Extraordinary."
tt0060827,"Persona is a film we return to over the years, for the beauty of its images and because we hope to understand its mysteries."
tt0060827,"One of the screen's supreme works and perhaps Ingmar Bergman's finest film, ""Persona"" is also his most radical in form and technique."
tt0060827,"Persona is a film to make you shiver with fascination, or incomprehension, or desire."
tt0060827,"Wonderfully complex but warmly human, Bergman's drama is one of his very best."
tt0060827,"Not an easy film, but an infinitely rewarding one."
tt0060827,"Persona feels like an act of disclosure on Bergman’s part, with him pulling back the curtain to acknowledge the fantasy of filmmaking and global realities that linger in his mind."
tt0060827,"Bergman blends a theatrical subjectivity—scenes of the inner life that defy physical reality and depend on special effects, whether in the film lab or on set—with a tactile visual intimacy, with his characters, the objects close at hand, and the superb coastal landscape."
tt0060827,"Persona (the ancient Latin word for mask) is too deliberately difficult to rank with Bergman's best. But in an era when the director who dares to repeat himself is rare indeed—when the cinematic world is full of one-shot wonders, Bergman's consistency is itself refreshing."
tt0060827,"Ingmar Bergman's best film, I suppose, though it's still fairly tedious and overloaded with avant-garde cliches."
tt0079470,"It has been said that a Monty Python movie is only successful if it offends everyone in the audience at least once. By that measuring stick as well as nearly any other, The Life of Brian is an unqualified triumph. It makes us confront our foibles and laugh at them."
tt0079470,Astringently funny masterpiece.
tt0079470,"The more things change, the more we have to laugh if we are to have a prayer of remaining sane, and the Pythons are the best possible step in that direction."
tt0079470,"""No God and no religion can survive ridicule,"" wrote Mark Twain, but for once the sage of Hannibal was wrong."
tt0079470,"While it may lack the sheer comic anarchy of their other work, Life of Brian may be probably the funniest collective efforts concocted by the British comedy troupe ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" is their most sustained effort. (Review of Original Release)"
tt0079470,Just as wacky and imaginative as their earlier film outings. (Review of Original Release)
tt0079470,Blessed are the Pythons for making holy wit of the Holy Writ.
tt0079470,"For all its scruffiness, the lurching strike-rate of its gags, and the unmistakable smell of amateur dramatics given off by its repertory of rotating players with their stick-on Ted Nugent beards, Life of Brian jitters with good will. [3 May 2004, p. 110]"
tt0079470,"Monty Python's Life of Brian, re-released on its 25th anniversary as an antidote to ""The Passion of the Christ,"" is a single-joke satire of organized religion, including Hollywood's."
tt0079470,"Sluggish, repetitive, and strangely timorous, with little of the zap and imagination of the Pythons' television work."
tt0129167,One of the best films of the year thus far.
tt0129167,"Heart and tenderness are rare in cartoon movies. But in an age of frenetic children's fare, the new animated adventure The Iron Giant dares to show a lot of both, and it comes up a winner."
tt0129167,"Surprising as it sounds, as far as examinations of trust, loyalty and identity go, the big metal dude's story winds up far more satisfying than the plodding Kubrick opus any day of the week."
tt0129167,"An animated tale equipped with heart, humor, blazing action and not a sappy song in earshot."
tt0129167,Keeps its sense of humor while dealing with serious issues.
tt0129167,"Still, the movie -- as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is -- has the annoyance of incredible smugness."
tt0129167,"A smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking."
tt0129167,A terrific feature-length cartoon.
tt0129167,More intelligent and thought-provoking than the usual dumb and dull-witted fare for children.
tt0129167,We are happy to report there is intelligent life in feature animation beyond planet Disney and the gaseous ball of foul language known as South Park.
tt1454029,Davis and Spencer give faces and fully-fleshed out lives to women who must have been more than what they did for a living as The Help.
tt1454029,"A deeply touching human story filled with humor and heartbreak is rare in any movie season, especially summer. That's what makes The Help an exhilarating gift."
tt1454029,"A stirring black-empowerment tale aimed squarely at white audiences, The Help personalizes the civil rights movement through the testimony of domestic servants working in Jackson, Miss., circa 1963."
tt1454029,Davis is reason No. 1 the film extracted from Kathryn Stockett's 2009 best-seller improves on its source material.
tt1454029,"The Help is, in some way, crude and obvious, but it opens up a broad new swath of experience on the screen, and parts of it are so moving and well acted that any objections to what's second-rate seem to matter less as the movie goes on. [15 & 22 August 2011, p. 96]"
tt1454029,"The acting is uniformly excellent, and the cause - dragging the beginnings of civil rights into Jackson, Miss., at great risk - couldn't be nobler. What the film lacks is a strong point of view."
tt1454029,The movie is too pious for farce and too eager to please to comment persuasively on the racial horrors of the Deep South at that time.
tt1454029,"Taylor does capture the Jim Crow era and its anxieties well, but his characters tend toward the facile and his white heroine is too idealized."
tt1454029,"A chick flick for do-gooders, The Help suffers from a malady common to the discrimination drama: its treatment of inequality is more condescending than the prejudice it aims to remedy."
tt1454029,High school creative-writing-class ironies of all kinds abound in The Help.
tt0103639,The movie that brought a hip new sensibility to animated features and which still stands up in the age of Pixar and DreamWorks thanks largely to a blistering improv turn from Robin Williams.
tt0103639,"Aladdin is a film of wonders. To see it is to be the smallest child, open-mouthed at the screen's sense of magic, as well as the most knowing adult, eager to laugh at some surprisingly sly humor."
tt0103639,"Despite a similar setting-the never-never land of the Arabian Nights — the new movie is hipper, faster, more topical."
tt0103639,"This is a fun motion picture on all levels, and, while it doesn't quite measure up to the standard established by Beauty, it's still one of the year's best bets for pure entertainment."
tt0103639,"Floridly beautiful, shamelessly derivative and infused with an irreverent, sophisticated comic flair thanks to Robin Williams' vocal calisthenics, Aladdin probably won't equal its beastly predecessor but should still enjoy a magic carpet ride through the holiday season."
tt0103639,"Aladdin is good but not great, with the exception of the Robin Williams sequences, which have a life and energy all their own."
tt0103639,"The animation seeks to dazzle, but with a self-consciousness that's relatively new to the Disney studio. The results are fun and fast moving, but far from sublime."
tt0103639,"The fundamentals here go beyond first-rate: animation both gorgeous and thoughtful, several wonderful songs and a wealth of funny minor figures on the sidelines, practicing foolproof Disney tricks. Only when it comes to the basics of the story line does Aladdin encounter any difficulties."
tt0103639,"Visually, it's a treat, a perfect marriage of hi-tech graphics and the traditional Disney virtue of strong characterisation and colour. The script crackles with wit and life. Williams' Genie is matched by Freeman's malevolent Jafar, and by Gottfried as Jafar's wisecracking parrot Iago. The only disappointments are the wet Aladdin and his sweetheart Jasmine and five rather ordinary original songs."
tt0103639,"Aladdin is ultimately less offensive than patently ridiculous, mostly because its ethnic white noise is really just an excuse for Robin Williams—as a postmodern blabbermouthed genie who grants Aladdin three wishes—to put on the most elaborate, narcissistic circus act in the history of cinema."
tt0099348,"A gigantic achievement, an endowment of riches."
tt0099348,This movie moves so confidently and looks so good it seems incredible that it's a directorial debut.
tt0099348,"Costner's directing style is fresh and assured. A sense of surprise and humor accompany Dunbar's adventures at every turn, twisting the narrative gently this way and that and making the journey a real pleasure."
tt0099348,"Costner (with Michael Blake's screenplay) creates a vision so childlike, so willfully romantic, it's hard to put up a fight."
tt0099348,"A three-hour delight&#133; The movie generates much of its power by being so life-affirming at a time when people feel nervous about the future. [9 Nov 1990, Friday, p.C]"
tt0099348,"The film's politically correct repudiation of the familiar black-and-white characterizations of the white and red man is ultimately undermined, however, when the pendulum swings too far in the other direction."
tt0099348,"The picture moves slowly but never sluggishly, and it never grinds down. The measured pace shows real assurance on the part of Costner. [9 Nov 1990, Daily Datebook, p.E1]"
tt0099348,"It would be nice, for instance, to meet some white man, other than Dunbar [Costner], who is not a brutish lout. And it would not harm the film if there were one or two bad-natured Sioux visible in it. [12 Nov 1990, p.102]"
tt0099348,"Smoothly directed by Kevin Costner, who also gives a sensitive performance in the leading role. The screenplay is often trite, however, and there's no reason for the picture's three-hour length. [9 Nov 1990, Arts, p.12]"
tt0099348,The movie is so busy turning the Sioux characters into photogenic saints that it never quite allows them the complications of human beings.
